[0:02:46] <ghoststabber> Hey @purple_hs what’s the top meta deck Rn?
[0:02:58] <scruffy52778> I've been bullying people with a bad control shaman recently
[0:04:24] <EnvoyHS> alarm-o-bot
[0:05:43] <BitByBitt> is dr mogran still trash?
[0:06:30] <MisterMonopoli> The turn 5 lethal for priest is going to be fun
[0:06:37] <BitByBitt> soo more control silence warlock?
[0:07:09] <80suppaman> @purple_hs what do you think of otk recless experimenter + snip snap?
[0:07:38] <foundyatriggergiggle> yeah what an idiot
[0:07:42] <BitByBitt> what was the combo?
[0:08:13] <BitByBitt> what was the broken combo?
[0:08:36] <MisterMonopoli> coppertail on turn 4, it has stealth. Then on turn 5 you play Reckless Experimenter and infinite snip snap echo.
[0:08:55] <foundyatriggergiggle> u just need a mech on board ,doesnt even need to be coppertail
[0:08:57] <EnvoyHS> not just coppertail it is any mech at all
[0:09:01] <MisterMonopoli> right
[0:09:09] <BitByBitt> holy shit
[0:09:15] <foundyatriggergiggle> t3 mech, t4 coin experimenter otk LUL
[0:09:26] <BitByBitt> wait it has to have death rattle right
[0:09:32] <BitByBitt> so mech priest is going to be a thing?
[0:09:37] <EnvoyHS> it is just snip snip
[0:09:56] <EnvoyHS> but you can search for it with the 2 drop that gets a deathrtattle\
[0:10:16] <McPro555> Sup purple
[0:10:18] <McPro555> :)
[0:10:49] <JJJ67> snip snap will be so busted

[0:17:17] <rcharriol> I guess im crafting priest cards now
[0:17:34] <malacoautismirl2> galon can u talk a bit about new magic carpet pogo hoper rogue? :)
[0:17:42] <JJJ67> guess experimentor or snip snap will get changed to discount 2 or 4 mana
[0:18:01] <McPro555> and you can get the snip snap with the 2/1 deathrattle: draw a deathrattle
[0:18:15] <Kingofallegends> wheres the bat?
[0:18:28] <rcharriol> isnt any mech with charge?
[0:18:32] <Sekins> @purple_hs I just got here why do you choose to have no AoE?
[0:18:43] <BitByBitt> This meta is getting flippd
[0:18:51] <malacoautismirl2> its only good because of magic carpet interaction
[0:19:00] <adanish22> They are adjusting mana costs for stuff that was overcosted due to genn and baku existing
[0:19:01] <McPro555> you can draw pogo with piper Pog
[0:19:36] <Killa19781664> mn ,,
[0:19:57] <BitByBitt> lacky shark rogue with pogo?

[0:27:10] <GladiusP> thanks for answering, was just wondering
[0:27:16] <BitByBitt> wait drawing cards is bad in aggro?
[0:27:23] <BitByBitt> how do you refill your hand?
[0:27:24] <IcyeneHS> Cards getting buffed hype!
[0:27:51] <twinedleaves> hey purple! semi new here but loving the streams the past few days/week!
[0:27:52] <malacoautismirl2> had*
[0:28:14] <TheAnomaly666> drawing cards is bad tempo but i normally prefer card draw to a higher curve
[0:28:17] <Chuuu> wait purple, someone probably asked
[0:28:17] <Gulumok> anyone remembers UI? Kappa
[0:28:22] <Chuuu> but did you see the new buffs/cards

[0:29:41] <GladiusP> do you agree with his sap ?
[0:30:15] <real_pepega> all of gm Matches is full of warriors and they dont nerf Dr boom Hero NotLikeThis
[0:30:57] <snowflipper_penguin> They kinda buffed him LUL
[0:31:19] <TheAnomaly666> once rogue is toned down warrior is easily built against
[0:31:34] <real_pepega> but thx god they cant banker the elsyana LUL
[0:31:44] <TheAnomaly666> the problem currently is people don't want to hard counter warrior and lose to rogue
[0:31:46] <BitByBitt> @TheAnomaly666 wait you mean like warrior wil be easy to play against?
[0:31:59] <TJSCOUSER_> Hey nerfs, what do you think of Purple?
[0:32:04] <TheAnomaly666> hunter can farm warrior extremely consistently with frenzy and zuljin

[0:32:27] <snowflipper_penguin> Elysianna nerf is a warrior buff, because before you had to run it but now the banker is a flex slot

[4:16:25] <kevinschmidt1> Yes
[4:16:37] <RealPrismsword> @MrBlack2 correct

[5:07:55] <MunchthatCrunch> this song lol
[5:08:05] <ikilledkenny_44> the buffs are more hype then the nerfs. They are like half an expansion worth of meta changes imo

[5:10:35] <StreamElements> i recommend you uninstall Hearthstone
[5:10:53] <thetowndrunk18> @ikilledkenny_44 Yes, you just can't stream to another platfrom as the same time as Twitch without prior consent from Twitch.
[5:11:15] <thetowndrunk18> Also whaddup Purple
[5:11:41] <ikilledkenny_44> i meant like would omni be allowed to upload the omni show on all of their twitch channels at once to max total overall viewers
[5:12:14] <Odsteel> @ikilledkenny_44 but why
[5:12:30] <thetowndrunk18> Yeah, but you'd have to use different streaming softwares since you can only input one stream key at a time.
[5:13:17] <Odsteel> @ikilledkenny_44 also leave kenny alone BibleThump
[5:13:17] <ikilledkenny_44> because Firebat and Kibler have different followings so more people will see the stream that way. just wondering though
[5:13:32] <ikilledkenny_44> Kenny deserved to die MingLee
[5:13:38] <thetowndrunk18> Easier to just host the Omni channel .

[5:37:48] <ImRhinne> thats such a good draw
[5:37:53] <alwayssnipingzeddy> you guys trolling? his sunfuryplay was better on board
[5:37:57] <deaddrawhs> Thats pretty debatable, taunt water lets him preserve more dmg
[5:38:04] <Sure_Thing> no rush no go
[5:38:08] <TheFrostCake> rng is better the sooner you play her Kappa
[5:38:25] <burrks> warpath clears either way
[5:38:32] <Fynr> maybe he "predicted" that you didnt have warpath Kappa
[5:38:34] <Mezmorizor> Those were pretty good xd
[5:38:36] <burrks> no matter the sunfury position warpath clears
[5:38:49] <burrks> your minion had 3 health and the 3 2 dies to two warpaths
[5:38:55] <alwayssnipingzeddy> @burrks thats a great point
[5:39:10] <alwayssnipingzeddy> very smart so his play was just strictly better
[5:39:39] <burrks> tbf im not claiming the player is good, just that specific play wasnt bad for "play around warpath" reasons

[7:21:13] <StreamElements> Murloc Shaman (May 21): AAECAfe5AgSQB6fuAu/3ArmZAw3FA9sD/gP/BdAHpwiTCeKJA4yUA7WYA7+YA8aZA/SZAwA=
[7:21:14] <cjnj193> how do we shove in stormbringer in this deck
[7:21:25] <ShroomiaCo> murloc shaman vs control warrior is a VERY strange matchup
[7:21:36] <ShroomiaCo> you dont have to think much but it goes for a while
[7:21:38] <davidgeek> good shaman SMOrc bad hunter SMOrc
[7:21:43] <layelife> who's he playing with?
[7:21:47] <McPro555> stormbringer post buff is only 1 mana more than bloodlust, think about it
[7:21:50] <ShroomiaCo> wabeka
[7:22:01] <cjnj193> rip mana wyrm
[7:22:30] <PJack777> SMOrc
[7:22:35] <ShroomiaCo> idk how i feel about stormbringer.... on one hand its powerful, on the other hand you dont really want 3 'bloodlusts', plus you usually RNG into one from hagatha anyways
[7:22:35] <PJack777> ooof!
[7:22:38] <davidgeek> OH NO
[7:22:39] <plus_eevee> LMAO
[7:22:41] <PJack777> oh nooo
[7:22:50] <PJack777> disaster

[7:22:52] <BigJoe25> Jebaited
[7:22:57] <PJack777> i was fooled
[7:23:07] <davidgeek> mistakes were made
[7:23:57] <ShroomiaCo> one benefit of this deck is that it doesn't keel over to mage like token druid does.
[7:24:05] <betaclash> hes played too much arena
[7:24:09] <HS_Skun> stormbringer is 4 mana 3-4 do nothing in a tempo deck, bad card in this deck
[7:24:34] <ShroomiaCo> @HS_Skun not that stormbringer, that would be stormchaser.
[7:24:39] <Vheyj81> If Skippy Joe Bob casts Rain of Toads, do you get overloaded?
[7:24:40] <Nuttyreaper> it draws bloodlust every time so it's pressure
[7:24:45] <Fehago> Purple
[7:24:59] <ShroomiaCo> stormbringer = transform board into legendaries
[7:26:10] <cjnj193> never lucky
[7:26:26] <HS_Skun> lol stormbringer is even worse in this deck, id rather have storm chaser
[7:26:27] <helmetwearer> it puts up an explosive
[7:26:37] <cjnj193> just a few 1/1s

[7:38:29] <Lightningman375> who is on the call?
[7:38:30] <Aaron_says> But then if you play Militia commander to kill miscreant you have a 4 health minion on board for Dyno
[7:40:05] <cjnj193> Are there really any 1 drops that you want late? Outside some spells?

[7:45:13] <infinite_penguins> better buff myra's then 4Head
[7:45:30] <Tameling> agree completely
[7:47:12] <alwayssnipingzeddy> was from magictrick not of the top
[7:47:40] <thatsourblood> I think they should buff all the cards. Stop pussy-footing around. Every card should cost 0 mana. Give all minions +5/+5. 20sec games. Let’s go
[7:47:47] <lowkey2317> get ready for some conjuring
[7:49:12] <calculatedsmorc> there is no way 1 conjurer's is optimal in any mage deck, that card carries
[7:49:42] <lowkey2317> SwiftRage
[7:49:54] <Atheistpuppy> Most mage decks would likely run 3, I'd imagine
[7:50:11] <Tameling> BrokeBack mage

[8:18:33] <Aaron_says> Wait I thought they were removing the keyword echo?
[8:18:53] <wilskil> The legendary should probably be a 4 drop which would also break the otk
[8:18:59] <calculatedsmorc> but snip snip is OP in warrior with boom, and you can get it from assembly and delivery drone, plus the other mech buffs make warrior even better
[8:19:15] <Salessandro3> ^there is a much more broken priest otk
[8:19:29] <mrcheeks617> Yeah the priest OTK is the issue

[8:21:58] <Nemfles> also astromancer buff

[8:23:04] <Salessandro3> is no one else tired of deathrattle hunter? i hated egg hunter and whelp deathratle mech hunter is just egg 2.0
[8:23:16] <Salessandro3> results buff is huge imo
[8:23:44] <alwayssnipingzeddy> you dont get to develop the minions die
[8:23:47] <calculatedsmorc> also good with NECROmechanic
[8:23:49] <alwayssnipingzeddy> its just a sweeper
[8:23:51] <Salessandro3> they die at the end

[8:25:24] <FlagKeeper313> omg i have all of these cards in my trash cards
[8:25:27] <AlwaysDMB> @Aaron_says doubtful OMEGALUL
[8:25:50] <Salessandro3> landscaping is 2 2/2s for 3 but there is token synergy in that deck
[8:26:20] <RobsUsername> even with meta shifting to favor mage?
[8:27:13] <RageQuit1985> sorcerers apprentice + luna's + AI
[8:27:16] <masterblaster999> ice block will save you from skipping turn 5
[8:27:18] <antmist> unless you're playing it in 10 with AI and playing 2 astromancers Kappa
[8:27:25] <Infinite_Way> yeah that card against a token druid or zoo is still a suicide
[8:27:25] <calculatedsmorc> maly+ alex+ antonidas mage ! Also you can Luna galaxy + nova + doomsayer same turn and then go of with the luna minion next turn PogChamp
[8:27:33] <Obeseious> @purple_hs offers redundancy with jepetto as well

[8:31:53] <Salessandro3> frozen was playing mech paladin w/ glowstone and it was pretty decent at 6
[8:31:59] <ImRhinne> That sounds terrible because you have to wait for turn 5

[8:33:53] <RufasGuts> I agree, I think they just should have increased the buff to +3/+3 and left the mana cost at 3
[8:33:53] <Salessandro3> lmao true
[8:33:54] <Aaron_says> I'm down for this meta
[8:33:55] <calculatedsmorc> Can't wait for the first AGGRO Priest ever monkaS

[8:34:00] <FlagKeeper313> @fry3via i do if i dust them a golden common is 400 dust i can craft 2 and save 300 dust however i have 7k by now
[8:34:05] <Bromli2000> We were the real test subjects all along
[8:34:09] <DisturbedOneHS> broke stone LUL
[8:34:18] <Salessandro3> i wish we had a meta w/ the nerfs and then have the buffs
[8:34:18] <Redvinez> argent squire
[8:34:21] <antmist> SMOrc priest is finally seeing the light
[8:34:22] <BeRewt> calculatedsmorc there was one, back in the days, pretty lame though
[8:34:25] <rickyp555> inner fire
[8:34:28] <Salessandro3> i was looking forward to the nerf meta but the buffs may fuck things up
[8:34:29] <Shinexblazer> so priest beats mech pala?
[8:34:30] <Aaron_says> Token Priest?
[8:34:41] <alwayssnipingzeddy> priest finally getting a use for mindblast SMOrc
[8:34:43] <Xophules> Use magic carpet
[8:34:45] <Aaron_says> Wait isn't there a 2/2 that copies deathrattles monkaS
[8:34:52] <Aaron_says> MORE ARMS
[8:34:53] <Sure_Thing> Zetalot has been struggling to make a non-nomi priest for weeks.. a sigh of relief for him LUL
[8:34:55] <DisturbedOneHS> clearly it's the turn 5 otk priest that's the meta breaker Kappa
[8:35:01] <Kicus> in that meta game will be decided on turn 2
[8:35:09] <calculatedsmorc> Magic carpet synergy! works with snip snip to
[8:35:09] <kijiji_genie> Pogo Hopper EleGiggle
[8:35:19] <Snuffyz123> magic carpet pogo hopper
[8:35:20] <Thewayitg0es> using resources to buff pogo hopper 4Head
[8:35:23] <RufasGuts> I’m scared of this buff
[8:35:30] <my_dad_is_kripp> @purple_hs return all your minions to hand can be used with pogo
[8:35:34] <Virium> it makes it better with garbage like youthful brewmaster
[8:35:39] <antmist> but by the time you draw your whole deck it doesn't matteR?
[8:35:44] <DisturbedOneHS> pogo is a mech? mech rogue ftw
[8:35:44] <kinelaz> what the fuck is this real
[8:35:49] <xXShuuXx> Welcome back jades LUL
[8:35:51] <ikilledkenny_44> you probably run the turn 5 otk package and the test subject arms package in the same deck
[8:35:54] <wilskil> Magic carpet!
[8:36:08] <calculatedsmorc> inb4 tempo pogo rogue with carpet, could fit into the togwaggle/miracle rogue with schemes
[8:36:16] <deiorean92> zilliax onto it is nuts though
[8:36:19] <Aaron_says> Give rogue crystology 😡
[8:36:20] <Shinexblazer> priest beats pala "best deck in the game" din?
[8:36:30] <AlienFX_> magic carpet
[8:36:59] <alwayssnipingzeddy> thunderhead change is fucking stupid
[8:37:04] <kijiji_genie> I have golden stormbringer PogChamp
[8:37:08] <Aaron_says> Murloc Shaman gonna run stormbringer now monkaS
[8:37:14] <DapperCoat> thunderheads still not that great
[8:37:18] <calculatedsmorc> Stormbringer + Thunderhead monkaS
[8:37:19] <GodzGift_420> fireball or bust
[8:37:22] <ImRhinne> imagine taking an already played card and buffing it LUL
[8:37:25] <TucanDo> thunderhead isnt great?
[8:37:28] <Salessandro3> swift messenger EleGiggle
[8:37:28] <Shinexblazer> cleric double hands
[8:37:32] <Shinexblazer> cleric double arms
[8:37:39] <GodzGift_420> shadow ward pain
[8:37:41] <notluis98> walk the plank?
[8:37:43] <alwayssnipingzeddy> dude blizzard printing fandrals with 6 hp NotLikeThis
[8:37:44] <Sure_Thing> woah why buff Thunderhead???
[8:37:44] <antmist> with shadow word pain or our thrice buffed test subject Kappa
[8:37:45] <rejvin12> ofc warlock and druid get trash card buffs but the good classes get good buffs LUL
[8:37:46] <Obeseious> fireball
[8:37:50] <TucanDo> Thunderhead is crazy, rest of overload package is still suspect though
[8:37:55] <calculatedsmorc> EMPEROR cobra EZ Clap
[8:37:55] <howdyhamburger> Thunderhead was already string lol
[8:38:00] <howdyhamburger> strong*
[8:38:01] <DapperCoat> overload cards just arent that great, you gonna play spirit wolfs?
[8:38:20] <Melqui88> that border sounds more reasonable though
[8:38:24] <Aaron_says> You know what else has 6 health? Magic carpet
[8:38:44] <OMGwronghole> You kill it with your mountain giant
[8:38:51] <Aaron_says> You know what else has 6 health? Water elemental
[8:39:02] <notluis98> what stat line should a 4 mana have to be playable without any text?
[8:39:16] <rejvin12> pogohopper magic carpet OMEGALUL
[8:39:41] <calculatedsmorc> that was baleful, for EZ controllock synergy
[8:40:03] <antmist> Clap
[8:40:08] <rejvin12> buffing warrior mechs LUL
[8:40:21] <GodzGift_420> nerf rogue buff mechs dumb
[8:40:29] <Aaron_says> Just buffing discover
[8:40:31] <AlwaysDMB> yeah but you'll discover them FeelsGoodMan Clap
[8:40:33] <Virium> buffing doctor bum TriHard
[8:40:43] <ImRhinne> omega assembly Pog
[8:40:44] <Shinexblazer> so priest arms beat mech paaldin?
[8:40:47] <howdyhamburger> better dr. boom time
[8:40:52] <StrikerQ7> Power of creation summons Dr. Morrigan
[8:40:52] <RemoteInflux> just lowkey boom buffs
[8:40:53] <Aaron_says> But if we give them more attack then warriors kill eachother faster EZ
[8:40:53] <amyzhen> Warrior
[8:40:54] <antmist> how were dr boom and conjurer's calling not nerfed? NotLikeThis
[8:40:55] <xXShuuXx> You may not play them, but youll descover them LUL
[8:40:59] <kijiji_genie> 2/6 for rover is insane
[8:41:07] <ikilledkenny_44> 4/6 or 3/7 is probably playable. twilight drake is really good when it comes down with 7 or more health and you have to sacrifice a lot to get that effect
[8:41:13] <Shinexblazer> @purple_hs so does the priest arms beat paladin?
[8:41:15] <masterblaster999> dr boom is a bullshit card
[8:41:24] <DapperCoat> hex
[8:41:25] <Obeseious> fireball
[8:41:31] <calculatedsmorc> Snip Snip with rush is MENTAL with rush boom , the 1/1s from deathrattle have rush monkaS why blizz FailFish
[8:41:42] <kijiji_genie> from ooze to poly meta PogChamp
[8:41:58] <KlizzX> Hs balance team FailFish
[8:43:07] <TheFrostCake> supercollider might get more attention
[8:43:17] <Shinexblazer> purps, does the priest arms destroy paladin?
[8:43:18] <c85hernandez> Priest is gonna be better because pain is super value now.
[8:43:35] <DapperCoat> dynomatic with charge does
[8:43:37] <RufasGuts> A return to curvestone, then?
[8:43:46] <calculatedsmorc> whats going to happen is tempo priest, mech paladin, some sort of conjure mage should be OP. warrior should be able to adapt to survive
[8:43:46] <Shinexblazer> priest extra arms vs "best deck in the game paladin"
[8:43:47] <Obeseious> control shaman with 4x silence will be strong
[8:43:50] <nitsarethetits> snip snip + reckless experimenter + random mech on the board is an OTK on its own lol
[8:43:56] <Salessandro3> i dont like curvestone tbh
[8:43:57] <ikilledkenny_44> seems liks 5 -> 6 is the breakpoint where you need hard removal yeah
[8:44:05] <DapperCoat> so is likkim thunderhead shammy good now?
[8:44:11] <alwayssnipingzeddy> @nitsarethetits OMG did you figure that out by yourself? Pogc
[8:44:14] <patrick_bircher> priest has a turn 5 otk
[8:44:21] <masterblaster999> what was purples consensus on my boy preparation
[8:44:27] <amyzhen> ;)
[8:44:31] <GafgarionHS> @purple_hs OTK Priest with the new legendary mech + dude that reduces deathrattle in 3
[8:44:31] <nitsarethetits> @alwayssnipingzeddy i know, i'm amazing, right?
[8:44:32] <sekmed> I just want to see mech decks in wild with the new Legendary
[8:44:34] <Chuuu> it was confirmed to work
