[0:26:26] <layelife> @Calmon_ that's not how it works, if a deck stops being tier 1 because other decks change their build/playstyle cause of it, then it gets weak- that's a good thing. It means the game meta evolves naturally without outside forces or involvement. Why do we need a nerf to something that has been naturally nerfed? and even then I'm fine with raiding party nerfs. prep nerfs are bad

[1:01:53] <greaterspirit> That game boom was not relevant but most of the time the rush to mechs thing is soul destroying to play against, every mech becomes a removal, if you’re in a tough spot with boom your % to make a comeback are way higher for the potential to discover armour, heals and for the increased number of removal in form of mechs.

[1:03:53] <BoredCertified> Against control shaman you would probably run Azalina instead so you could steal Shutterwock and Elysiana
[1:04:02] <Mouse421> do you expect control warrior to still run it?
[1:04:08] <TheFrostCake> and harder to have multiple elysiana i think
[1:04:27] <McPro555> just militia commander

[1:05:15] <BoredCertified> @rcharriol They will most likely keep those cards in their hand for quite a while so unless Azalina is at the bottom of your deck it’s not hard
[1:05:31] <davidgeek> do you have an alternative nerf for miscreant that you would like to see or suggest?
[1:05:33] <Obeseious> sunreaver warmage does 4
[1:05:57] <Ocmer> there's gonna be more lackeys, so over time it'll be less powerful
[1:06:01] <Coximus> double prep raiding dummy
[1:06:24] <crvyxn> LUL
[1:06:32] <jarofheartsosrs> do u think rogue drops the pirate package
[1:06:47] <Dragon_Pangolin> @Ocmer lackeys are this set only
[1:06:55] <Obeseious> prep lost synergy with togwaggle as well. myras worse
[1:07:03] <ProphetFlume> they've said there will be more lackeys
[1:07:17] <greaterspirit> @purple_hs do you think hooktusk decks will come back in the game with party and prep nerf?
[1:07:18] <rogerontesting> @purple_hs Prep+RP = AI seems misleading, RP is still a tutor as opposed to general card draw
[1:07:32] <PJack777> very well put
[1:07:49] <wabekaHS> @purple_hs the follow up to that tempo was 4 damage and 3/3 a lot of the time as well
[1:07:54] <Dirac_hs> myracle rogue was close to tier 1 before rotation and rogue got a lot more help in this expansion
[1:07:58] <Obeseious> maybe rogue will revert to hook tusk package
[1:07:59] <wabekaHS> so the tempo netted you even more tempo the next turn
[1:08:17] <mrleesan> Is there a way to earn gold from these nerfs if I don't have the cards?
[1:08:19] <Coximus> master's call also requires a full deck commitment to beasts
[1:08:24] <mrleesan> earn dust*
[1:08:38] <guiletv> No
[1:08:45] <guiletv> Only hall of fame
[1:08:48] <nickshotpye> no mrleesan
[1:08:50] <O_Groupie> craft the cards, win more because you have a better deck

[1:09:40] <tcguru_> is it me or is he sometimes losing audio?
[1:09:43] <wabekaHS> @purple_hs Hooktusk might make a comeback
[1:09:52] <malacoautismirl2> @purple_hs what changes would u like to see?
[1:09:54] <mrbungle86> probably french pronunciation @McPro555
[1:10:01] <McPro555> true true
[1:10:04] <foundyatriggergiggle> 4 mana draw 3 suddenly awful, back in the days ppl would prep sprint LUL
[1:10:11] <Ocmer> fan of knives is terrible after Nerf's imo, means that aggro is even harder to deal with
[1:10:14] <jpetty> do you think they should of done something about conjurer's in mage?
[1:10:16] <BoredCertified> Prep raiding into 4/2 weapon, 3/3 taunt and draw 3 cards was like a mini ultimate infestation
[1:10:18] <HS_Skun> I think they should have made prep 1 mana reduce by 3
[1:10:24] <ProphetFlume> @Dragon_Pangolin i am lazy. but they said it will continue in the expansions all year.
[1:10:27] <alkazabar> tess rogue
[1:10:39] <hghrmnd> @foundyatriggergiggle Its not just a normal draw he talked about that
[1:10:43] <ecolitos1> they did'nt learn from the tournament last night that warrior was by far the best deck?
[1:10:45] <BitByBitt> Will you tess rogue still work?
[1:10:52] <PJack777> hooktusk cursed castaway rogue back?? PogChamp
[1:11:02] <O_Groupie> I'm not sold on hooktusk. Not enough good pirates
[1:11:03] <Yaya_> MALYGOS HUNTER TIME, BABY
[1:11:07] <Obeseious> @purple_hs can control warlock find a niche now
[1:11:33] <O_Groupie> Shaman is the fatigue class now
[1:11:44] <YouSayBooyah> @bitbybitt people will still run weapon removal.. you need cutlass for tess to work
[1:12:22] <Obeseious> now plot twist can beat warrior in fatigue too
[1:12:26] <foundyatriggergiggle> well, mage can be greedier with party rogue nerf pushing warrior out
[1:12:40] <crazil> so overall would you say tempo rouge is the best class at the moment?
[1:12:41] <ProphetFlume> kek
[1:12:50] <fatcat666> warior beat hunter
[1:12:51] <123brokeback123> plot twist warlock has 30% against everything LUL
[1:13:07] <ThatKwasi> so i guess, you like the changes?
[1:13:08] <durdlemaster> so why do they make people play 2 days of a dead format?
[1:13:08] <mangemano> Thanks for the review dude
[1:13:13] <wabekaHS> Tempo Rogue's early game is dictating the greediness of decks
[1:13:14] <Tromic> Conjurers not getting nerfed is what gets me, that card leads to the most uninteractive games
[1:13:19] <wabekaHS> there's going to be a LOT of change as a result
[1:13:28] <wabekaHS> usually, when the best aggressive deck gets nerfed, a lot changes
[1:13:30] <pot0fgreeed> @purple_hs just got here, have you talked about the nerfs yet?
[1:13:35] <nickshotpye> control shaman will rise a lot imo
[1:13:36] <jp_vLeroux> even prep?
[1:13:41] <wabekaHS> It should be really interesting
[1:13:47] <Coximus> we need a three mana neutral card to able to deal with mountain giant
[1:13:48] <fatcat666> you can put a nice duble bgh in warior for mage
[1:13:51] <crazil> did you play classic WoW in the past?
[1:13:54] <PJack777> yea, mountain may go the way of molten in the future
[1:13:54] <Coximus> maybe some sort of 4/2
[1:13:59] <O_Groupie> I've been saying that about giant since the rotation started. I jam it in every class
[1:14:01] <Heyitsmanzi> Do you agree with Blizzard not changing boom because they think warrior will be able to be countered
[1:14:02] <Dragon_Pangolin> ive been sick of giants and leeroy for years now
[1:14:05] <SebasCapo> @Tromic Maybe rotate Giant tbh
[1:14:06] <crazil> how you like the hype about the beta of classic wow atm?
[1:14:12] <ngoko07> the evil miscreant nerf was like they did nothing. they should have increased it 1 mana
[1:14:13] <malacoautismirl2> u mean u want to coin giant? Keepo
[1:14:14] <rcharriol> Yeah, not being able to coin giants, Lame
[1:14:15] <c85hernandez> Is dr boom fair?

[1:14:39] <PJack777> yep
[1:14:41] <yagmumru> so more big priest
[1:14:41] <bigchokeboi> have you talked about nerfs yet

[1:16:14] <SebasCapo> @Yaya_ Didn't they revert it because Wild is supposed to be Wild and not because they thought they were wrong?
[1:16:34] <Yaya_> Could Mountain Giant find a place in Big Shaman? It's not a good pull off of Muckmorpher but Hagatha gives you super large hands and it sticks well with Ancestral Spirit and Big Bad Voodoo

[1:22:39] <WeCameAsBurritos> @purple_hs I think giant has avoided Nerf for the same reason malygos has
[1:22:53] <ShaiiG> @c85hernandez I see mana-cheating as playing cards for less than their mana cost, ie skull of manari, possessed lackey. reducing your hero power cost doesnt feel the same to me, but thats just my opinion

[1:31:29] <Rehio> @giantdwa - Impossible to tell, I think? The entire meta is going to shift. What counters what is going to have to be re-evaluated.
[1:31:33] <globalistasis> is the "Your Opponent" not a thing any more? i havent seen it in a long time but maybe Blizz nerfed the "appear offline" feature? @purple_hs
[1:31:43] <yagmumru> hey @purple_hs do you want some self-respect to gamble away?
[1:31:52] <manofcheese575> @purple_hs as a professional hs pro, what do you think of the nerfs
[1:31:57] <pastaacz> Nerfed elyssiana actually makes warrior better since they don't have to play brewmaster no more

[1:49:14] <SebasCapo> I usually save both Warpaths and let them do whatever, just play minions and then with enough armor you can tank a whole Nomi turn, play warpath 5 times and then next turn play it the other one once, but maybe it's just luck

[1:58:23] <chniniboum> @charonhs HeyGuys
[1:58:31] <CharonHS> @chniniboum yo
[1:58:33] <SippShip1> im sort of a weeb
[1:58:52] <SippShip1> i dont like ghosts too much, but i do like cyberpunk
[1:59:07] <Rehio> Ghost in the Shell must be conflicting.
[1:59:09] <chniniboum> @charonhs What do you think about the nerf ?
[1:59:21] <Ariok> @purple_hs Mecha'thun
[1:59:32] <L0lf2p> rar.xd
[1:59:38] <SippShip1> well ghosts are a japanese invention
[1:59:39] <CharonHS> @chniniboum they forgot boom + conjurer which were much more important
[1:59:44] <zoromon2> i wonder what is the left most card xD

[2:00:04] <RIP_t2_croissance> @zoromon2 find out on turn seven SoonerLater
[2:00:07] <SippShip1> doesnt quite conflict with ghost in the shell cause ghosts in ghost in the shell are kind of something different
[2:00:57] <SippShip1> I like it when purple doesnt burn his mad genius
[2:01:05] <SippShip1> like yesterday

[2:02:27] <CharonHS> @chniniboum yep, war will always t1 with boom. And it's probably better for him in tour because he doesn't need panda and can play a better card
[2:02:31] <yzanas> coulnt he have done that exact same play but kept his commander?
[2:02:34] <zoromon2> this paladin card is super annoying
[2:02:39] <yzanas> trade commander into dragon double slam the giant
[2:03:01] <CharonHS> @chniniboum to me boom make we can't play ctrl, nor aggro. Just highroll meta with deck like giants mage and it bored me :/

[2:19:54] <MrBlack2> I struggle to find a better term
[2:19:57] <ShoppingCartPro> ShoppingCartPro subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:19:59] <SippShip1> time to decide for me if i take a sleeping pill or i can just go dormant by myself
[2:20:30] <MrBlack2> smells like Maly
[2:20:32] <RIP_t2_croissance> @SippShip1 is that a lucenbark joke ? WutFace
[2:20:50] <MrBlack2> I played quite a bit of maly druid first couple of weeks
[2:21:08] <SippShip1> well to be honest i slept 3 hours and im awake for quite some time already
[2:21:19] <MrBlack2> oh yeah its never maly actually he played a mct
[2:21:27] <SippShip1> but i kind of cant sleep, but i dont take drugs
[2:21:43] <MrBlack2> this class cant kill big stuff
[2:21:48] <SippShip1> just stressed out from irl stuff with family
[2:21:53] <SippShip1> my mother had birthday today
[2:22:07] <CharonHS> @purple_hs are you favored vs bomb war with this giant war ?
[2:22:31] <SippShip1> because i dont have irl friends
[2:22:40] <SippShip1> or near to none

[2:25:13] <Mush27> this Omega Devastator card seems quite strong
[2:25:38] <SippShip1> its just a cardgame, shouldnt have any impact on my private life OMEGALUL
[2:25:42] <TJSCOUSER_> he can floop faceless anyway i guess
[2:25:42] <doritodewfedoralord112> just don't hit him then he can't heal 4Head
[2:25:43] <SippShip1> ofc
[2:25:58] <MrBlack2> most devastators I've had played in one game vs me was 7.. so dumb LUL
[2:26:08] <yzanas> dont think so
[2:26:12] <yzanas> jsut kill it 4Head
[2:26:19] <GladiusP> @purple_hs any cards that you're unsure about in this list, or some you considered ?
[2:26:19] <DrakeAcula> you lose every time @purple_hs
[2:26:27] <youngwolf2010> Everytime I play this matchup with control mirror, I never attack so he can never heal.
[2:26:50] <MrBlack2> he probably waits for gloopsprayer next turn
[2:26:54] <taylorrs76> sometime they alex themselves, if averybody is full he can't regen them
[2:26:57] <booyah_for_all> @purple_hs I've heard that the smoothness of your background screen is directly related to your worth as a human being and you happen to have folds on yours. :/
[2:27:15] <globalistasis> @youngwolf2010 do you also never play stuff? because he can like, attack into it, you know 4Head
[2:27:21] <yzanas> new card PogChamp
[2:27:29] <Pixarclown> alex just gives him more heal targets?
[2:27:31] <GladiusP> he's playing healing touch WutFace
[2:27:34] <youngwolf2010> @globalistasis I have played this matchup many time with control warrior and I have never lost
[2:27:53] <sandstreampop> sandstreampop subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Have some quarters, Orange
[2:28:14] <MrBlack2> he can res them exactly 5 times I believe from here @purple_hs
[2:28:26] <globalistasis> @youngwolf2010 what ranks do people even play this druid at? i havent seen a single one since the expansion hit :)
[2:28:28] <yzanas> wtf LUL
[2:28:34] <TJSCOUSER_> probably at least 5 right
[2:28:45] <booyah_for_all> Pretty dank Druid deck Kreygasm
[2:28:46] <youngwolf2010> @globalistasis I played one yesterday that was ranked 200.
[2:28:46] <TJSCOUSER_> 2nd healing touch, 2 crystal powers, 2 ancients

[2:29:06] <TJSCOUSER_> we ded
[2:29:41] <malacoautismirl2> elysiana into 4 tinkmasters
[2:30:05] <yzanas> nop
[2:30:33] <levinyardo> It it even good against you? if you know what you re playing against you dont hurt him and thats it no?
[2:30:41] <levinyardo> unless he plays the 1/3 dealing 5
[2:30:46] <malacoautismirl2> he will alex himself
[2:30:53] <malacoautismirl2> and then fatigue will dmg him
[2:30:59] <Forefather> beats off meta warrior decks

[2:31:35] <MrBlack2> I thought it beat bomb warrior harder
[2:31:45] <RIP_t2_croissance> oh hey @GladiusP FutureMan
[2:31:47] <MrBlack2> when are the nerfs happening
[2:31:52] <Forefather> it might beat priest but i doubt it can combo fast enough

[2:34:08] <diceyyy> this is waht he do
[2:34:10] <MrBlack2> yeah he made the deck look very good
[2:34:11] <blaze1966> Thjis as well
[2:34:12] <LogikEmily> dog is like kibler but he plays slightly better decks than kibler
[2:34:12] <RIP_t2_croissance> dont do this at home
[2:34:29] <GladiusP> LUL
[2:34:35] <yronnoc> well kibler goes full meme... never go full meme
[2:34:43] <The_dice_miceter> @endlessrevolt Thanks dolphinLove
[2:34:49] <TheAnomaly666> why do people like mech hunter so much?
[2:34:49] <RIP_t2_croissance> says the guy who runs the fox and king mukla in every deck
[2:34:50] <Darluk001> kibler is like dog but he plays slightly worse decks than dog Kappa
[2:34:55] <wabekaHS> @purple_hs Says the guy who played Axe Flinger warrior
[2:35:03] <MrBlack2> I'm the same to a certain degree I'm an EU player and only play meme'ish decks and get pretty high ranks
[2:35:11] <endlessrevolt> what those were the best cards in the decks
[2:35:31] <RIP_t2_croissance> he made you think so @endlessrevolt
[2:35:37] <MrBlack2> my first legend after getting back to the game this expansion was with maly druid which is considered garbage

[3:35:00] <kornondekock> What are the nerfs?
[3:35:00] <BitByBitt> @PokerJoker811 is that a joke?
[3:35:03] <Vheyj81> Warrior is just stupid because it gives all mechs rush. Combine that with cards like Dyn-o-matic and Omega Destroyer and Warrior is way, way too efficient at removal
[3:35:03] <Dawnjabes> salut purple
[3:35:06] <CritECal> Warriors just gonna be the same deck with no brewmaster and more bombs
[3:35:06] <PokerJoker811> @kruppe_the_first Elysiana to 9.
[3:35:08] <RavenHS> also I think their idea is nerfing rogue changes the landscape of the meta, so there will be less warrior because less rogue etc etc
[3:35:18] <kruppe_the_first> that's very shite
[3:35:19] <RavenHS> and its ok, definitely rough since im here for a while
[3:35:27] <CritECal> What decks beat warrior tho
[3:35:31] <kruppe_the_first> not like they used that 3 mana for anything else than the heropower
[3:35:36] <RavenHS> but GM seems pretty fun so far (less so for team warrior over in NA ofc) :P
[3:35:37] <VyyZ> a billion decks beat warrior
[3:35:44] <VyyZ> most can't be played due to rogue atm
[3:35:47] <baconlord777> i just played 3 bloodlusts as murlock shaman on a full board because i high rolled kalecgos feels good man

[3:35:51] <CritECal> @vyyz such as
[3:35:52] <BitByBitt> @Vheyj81 if you look at the stats, warrior isn't has broken as the current rogue. Warrior just feels bad to play against cause of all the answer it can generate.
[3:35:57] <RavenHS> I think shaman might low key be the nuts now
[3:36:04] <mooledeye> every class has a deck that beats warrior
[3:36:07] <VyyZ> greedy mages, greedy hunters, greedy paladins, greedy rogues
[3:36:15] <ruhigtoter> @RavenHS We can only hope. I actually was pretty ok with ladder meta. Tournament meta from viewer poiny was... tiresome
[3:36:19] <CritECal> @ravenhs murloc shaman or control
[3:36:21] <Dirac_hs> coin plague monkaS
[3:36:35] <ruhigtoter> would you prefer more diverse tournament meta?
[3:36:40] <RavenHS> @ruhigtoter I am a bit more biased since apac was actually sweet, we had all of the different matchups
[3:36:41] <baconlord777> @RavenHS I have a 65% winrate on murlock shamen in top 200
[3:36:51] <RavenHS> @CritECal thunderhead control
[3:37:03] <CritECal> @vyyz warrior fan tech against mages and mages don’t have a lot of heal so bombs put a clock on most decks
[3:37:13] <PokerJoker811> TBH (and I know my track record today is poor), I think the tournament meta is limiting the ladder meta right now, not the other way around.
[3:37:14] <CritECal> @ravenhs with Elysiana shudderwock?
[3:37:20] <Vheyj81> Where are the stats taken from? If that from, say, top 500 legend, that would be ok, but stats taken even from top 5 ranked would be misleading. Warrior is just harder to play. A lot of rogues just go face, which is easier, so it will appear to be more busted at lower ranks
[3:37:24] <RavenHS> @CritECal not elys just shudder

[3:39:30] <Griselbrand87> Don’t know how great shaman is against hunter tbh
[3:39:35] <ruhigtoter> @RavenHS Yeah, apac meta was pretty sweet and not a lot mirrors. I stuck writing essay cause i cant seriously procrastinate over infinite warriors mirrors in other regions LUL
[3:39:47] <RavenHS> I also think the tech cards for a shaman 2ndary deck would be good, you can put in maybe more minion value

[5:48:57] <Vheyj81> ...Vanqueef?
[5:49:06] <EthandComer> So the nerf and the extra dust is in two days?

[5:49:27] <brkw0w> ty @taylorrs76
[5:49:28] <Sure_Thing> riding in his new buscetti
[5:49:41] <Destruct_You> Haven’t seen this guy lowroll once LUL
[5:49:46] <TheMarBLeKinG> Why dont you play Yeti in this deck? SO bad @purple_hs
[5:50:02] <Vheyj81> Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good at HS
[5:50:20] <slavicbeard> I play wisps,yeti and footman in my warrior deck.
[5:50:53] <PeTerBauM> x80bHey
[5:51:04] <owenk29> They should make it so Edwin is a spell that can be prepped out, not strong enough imo
[5:51:25] <profpillz> his wisps are too strong
[5:51:37] <hambonerrr> you won't have to for long 4Head
[5:51:43] <owenk29> Well cya to this game :)
[5:51:59] <GameDiceHS> !points
[5:51:59] <StreamElements> @GameDiceHS, GameDiceHS has 20468 Self-Respect and is rank 21/48321 on the leaderboard.
[5:52:10] <Destruct_You> Another fun game of the rogue mirror :))
[5:52:27] <Sure_Thing> Turn 5 games or Turn limit games PogChamp
[5:52:51] <BrotherManB> Forgot to draw edwin :/
[5:53:57] <calderon78i> rogue nerfs didnt go far enough imo Kappa
[5:54:29] <Freakin_Stinkin> LUL
[5:54:41] <Vheyj81> They could just turn all cards into Edwin, except Alysana, which only discovers Edwin
[5:54:55] <alexander_of_greece> edwin should also read gain +1/+1 for each card played just to rub it in LUL
[5:56:05] <profpillz> its fine we get boom on 7, we good players EZ
[5:56:20] <profpillz> didn't boom on 7 DansGame
[5:56:59] <profpillz> i mean realistically thats neve going to happen though is it?
[5:57:11] <amyzhen> Is witchwood card should be considered？
[5:57:45] <profpillz> well nvm
[5:57:52] <profpillz> i guess if he does nothing one turn you c an
