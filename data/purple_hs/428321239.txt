[0:06:46] <StreamElements> @cjnj193 you got 4Head | 4Head | 4Head and won 8971 Self-Respect PogChamp //
[0:07:11] <khell_hs> I feel like purple should have way more viewers than this 🤔
[0:07:33] <RufasGuts> Tempo khadgar
[0:07:52] <RufasGuts> @khell_hs stream only just started
[0:08:42] <RufasGuts> But I agree he deserves more viewers in general
[0:09:35] <TheDeegs> youre my favorite streamer
[0:09:39] <AmazingGO4T> I love your hair @purple_hs !
[0:10:09] <TheDeegs> i like streamers that dont take 2 years per turn
[0:10:10] <Deluvina> What not to like, good music and good plays
[0:10:36] <NovaMoGraph> when are the nerfs coming
[0:10:48] <RufasGuts> Ez
[0:10:50] <khell_hs> Nozdormu making turns 15 seconds is the biggest lie in HS
[0:11:03] <RufasGuts> @novamograph like really soon I think
[0:11:49] <cjnj193> i do really wanna see someone bring norzdormu to gms, gotta hard counter the meta
[0:12:00] <LukeCashMoney> @purple_hs as it turns out, 6 9 drops for 8 mana is pretty good
[0:12:34] <nguyenma> do you think many old legendary minions deserve buffs
[0:12:41] <RufasGuts> @lukecashmoney crazy right?
[0:12:49] <cjnj193> member when oakheart was bad? i member
[0:12:58] <RufasGuts> Cheating mana good
[0:13:00] <Espla> Play rogue PepeHands
[0:13:15] <RufasGuts> Tempo good
[0:13:33] <khell_hs> @purple_hs what are your thoughts on paladin post nerf? I feel like it’s going to be strong.
[0:14:05] <Melqui88> @purple_hs does a new 4/4 make conjurer's calling any worse for 7 drops or not noticably
[0:15:15] <swagyolo420weedscopes> r the nerfs live?
[0:15:29] <RufasGuts> @swagyolo420weedscopes soon
[0:16:20] <RufasGuts> I guess we need to start running owls and spellbreakers
[0:16:26] <RufasGuts> Mech paladin scares me
[0:16:59] <biscuit717z> Hey @purple_hs hope all is going well
[0:17:37] <Vheyj81> the dinosaur says RAWR
[0:17:40] <RufasGuts> Woooo
[0:18:34] <knotastalker> that's what she said
[0:18:57] <RufasGuts> Pogger
[0:18:57] <biscuit717z> hoggers poggers
[0:19:27] <RufasGuts> So after he warpaths we... do something?
[0:19:53] <yagmumru> is anybody currently available to friend me so i can spectate and win a classic pack if you win?
[0:19:58] <RufasGuts> Pog
[0:20:22] <AzubuR> is midrange hunter any good after the nerf on rogue?
[0:20:46] <RufasGuts> @azubur I think it will be, and smarter people than me have said the same
[0:21:50] <knotastalker> rawr
[0:23:04] <biscuit717z> are you playing a juggalo?
[0:23:20] <biscuit717z> against a juggalo
[0:24:50] <Melqui88> created by victory as it should be
[0:26:58] <RufasGuts> Good old AI
[0:27:06] <RufasGuts> It’s the vanilla of card draw
[0:27:28] <WildChitose> lol
[0:27:38] <bhwears22> first one just freezes
[0:27:51] <bhwears22> 1 freeze 2 damage 2 damage
[0:27:52] <RufasGuts> People say it’s boring but I say vanilla is a delicious and an underrated flavor in its own right
[0:27:53] <Melqui88> initial freeze does no damage

[0:36:27] <Vheyj81> casual 40/40 for 3 mana. Can you imagine showing a 2015 HS player that? They'd cum in their pants

[0:40:00] <Chuuu> PogCamp it works
[0:40:19] <The_Worthless> she is a gnome dude
[0:40:26] <RufasGuts> The real deck building challenge is trying to make a conjurer’s deck that ISN’T broken
[0:40:30] <Mythirteen> she is a Gnome after all
[0:40:31] <Chuuu> probably based on her hand to arm ratio OpieOP
[0:40:42] <ranchfish> her head is way bigger than her body
[0:40:53] <wabekaHS> @purple_hs blizzard said the nerfs are live
[0:41:10] <Chuuu> probably have to relog then
[0:41:15] <Vheyj81> she's clearly a gnome, and therefore short and basically an article of food

[1:20:13] <Mythirteen> i agree i love amaz. but thats what most people say. amaz has a lot of hatters
[1:20:22] <sireful> Legitimately bothers me that the term "ghosting" has been essentially dropped just because people think it's easier to use "sniping" to mean both things.
[1:20:45] <alwayssnipingzeddy> fuck this sucks big time
[1:20:46] <breakfast_boi21> tempo 2/2
[1:20:47] <Salessandro3> does sniping mean looking at queue times or watching the stream

[1:20:56] <davidgeek> if thats what bothers you i would reconsider your priorities

[2:50:17] <ShroomiaCo> e.g. the first minion played wins
[2:50:22] <utterlymilked> like the biggest dude survives on both sides of the board and then those two attack eachother
[2:50:28] <utterlymilked> more thematically congruent
[2:50:39] <ShroomiaCo> that card existed (enter the coliseum) and was never played, but it was 6 mana
[2:50:42] <utterlymilked> yeah
[2:50:50] <utterlymilked> but that was 6 mana
[2:50:55] <utterlymilked> and they didn't attack eachother
[2:50:58] <ShroomiaCo> also paladin had equality
[2:51:16] <utterlymilked> it would probably see play in the mech decks
[2:51:24] <abbelito_1337> should they nerf conjurers calling and remove the twinspell effect? i havent played this deck or faced this deck much but by spectating it seems a bit too strong?

[2:53:22] <blackfox1994> @abbelito_1337 No, sure it's broken when you can slam Giants on 3, but that's not too common and you die very easily to any sort of aggression.
[2:53:23] <Roi_liefi> the fact that you can kill one or two big guys just playing a little 1 1 that wins the brawl make the card better than enter imo
[2:53:33] <Valmont_jc> @purple_hs may you add "hearthstone tracker plugin" for ur channel ?

[2:54:46] <utterlymilked> the dooms are for the mirror no?
[2:54:58] <DTrainHS> I think Nova is good cause it synergizes with Sea Giant
[2:55:02] <Gehkar> 2 frost and 1 doom makes more sense no?
[2:55:26] <blackfox1994> @purple_hs Water Elementals are pretty interesting techs against Supercollidors.

[2:55:30] <EthandComer> @Gehkar We play a ton of freeze and the deck needs board clears.
[2:55:37] <dunn0ck> add jaina 4Head
[2:55:50] <vegasgrind> when is nerf
[2:56:06] <utterlymilked> hm mage would be so strong in specialist if jaina were a card
[2:56:13] <EthandComer> @Gehkar especially early game clears because the deck operates in mid to late game.
[2:56:16] <utterlymilked> just hof hero cards 4Head
[2:56:40] <utterlymilked> wait is 4Head high def now?
[2:56:41] <blackfox1994> @utterlymilked Mage is pretty strong in Specialist regardless. It's doing very well for itself at Grandmasters.
[2:57:05] <SMOrc101> You're missing a pocket galaxy for 5 mana in this deck. Keepo

[3:00:00] <bloodyfacehs> it's pretty absurd the # of cards mage needs to beat warrior
[3:00:24] <ducktrophy> did u guys see new genius turn 5 otk legendary?
[3:00:26] <tannertee> @purple_hs maybe harrison instead of ooze if youre going to specifically target super collider? just to help with card draw since you took out the research projects
[3:00:28] <blackfox1994> @bloodyfacehs By that same merit, it can be pretty hard for Warrior to beat Mage without Supercollidor.
[3:00:32] <EthandComer> @blackfox1994 He isn't the best play in the deck. But he is always going to be at least decent. I think the deck should play it now that rogue is on a decent downswing.
[3:00:38] <RCIX> i think kalecgos's strength is that eventually the mage will generate a ton of value through free spells, more than an immediate impact.

[3:01:21] <yahoodfs> Warriors run bgh and collider isn’t favor for mage
[3:01:47] <ducktrophy> i usually beat warriors with mage but not this kind of mage
[3:01:51] <EthandComer> @DTrainHS I actually think that mage is not very good against warrior.

[3:02:35] <blackfox1994> @yahoodfs The match up is now less skewed because Warrior isn't forced to run certain cards (Banker Elysiana for instance) to not lose the mirror. BGH can be pretty terrible. And supercollidor feels bad in an Ooze meta.
[3:02:36] <ShroomiaCo> except this one

[3:03:14] <blackfox1994> @yahoodfs It's a bit of a moot point because this version of Mage has no weapon removal, I'll grant you.
[3:03:16] <ShroomiaCo> zilliax enables spellbreaker was my statement @ducktrophy
[3:03:36] <blackfox1994> @DTrainHS Mech Hunter is still pretty solid I imagine.
[3:03:55] <EthandComer> @DTrainHS I think that hunter is relatively good against warrior. Especially secret hunter. Mech hunter is also a little favored, but depends on the players.
[3:04:19] <blackfox1994> @Temurshaman Agreed, so many Mech Hunters play that match up incredibly wrong.
[3:04:24] <DTrainHS> I don't see how Secret Hunter can generate even close to enough threats
[3:04:48] <blackfox1994> @purple_hs Water Elementals are interesting with invocations?
[3:04:49] <DTrainHS> Rat Trap is also a lot worse with less Rogues around

[3:09:14] <xblod4rx> Elysiana still is a good card in control warrior?
[3:09:21] <DTrainHS> How is doing the same play 1 turn later helping with that?
[3:09:26] <laylofosho> is luna not worth it as card draw
[3:09:30] <TheFD> super collider would "only" kill a 7/8 and nearly also kill an 8/8. doesn't seem too bad lol
[3:09:52] <EthandComer> @DTrainHS You could just kill him. Or he could have a normal amount of removal and you just gave him several turns to rebuild.
[3:10:21] <blackfox1994> @laylofosho From personal experience, Luna is such a clunky, awkward card to play. It's a very good draw engine, but you often struggle to draw more than 3 cards a turn without making weird plays. Especially in a deck like this.

[3:56:15] <Odsteel> did you just assume its gender HotPokket
[3:56:16] <CharmingRogue851> @arithemonkey oh ok lol, Rogue with Vandetta is still good. Just drop the pirate package and the weapon

[3:57:02] <Touillette> 20/80*
[3:57:23] <CharmingRogue851> @arithemonkey check RDU stream or twitter
[3:57:33] <Smartalec821> weren't you supposed to play a giant first?

[4:01:41] <sasap123> @Mtakleh if you wanna play that deck for sure and its generally a card that sees occasional play in quite a few metas
[4:01:46] <Vee_HS> sure Kappa

[4:03:34] <SethCx> do you think they'll address the priest OTK?
[4:03:35] <Battletoads82> our thirsty hero returns,
[4:03:35] <Touillette> CharmingRogue851 yeah I don't know that particular list very well
[4:03:36] <notbenq1111> Which version of conjurer mage should I craft? Dragon or cyclone?
[4:03:36] <Rethen283> @Touillette depends, if hunter/warlock/druid(token) take rogue's place then it might be even better than before, if the meta ends up all warr/mage then it might be better to replace
[4:03:37] <PhillieMo> without his tic he wouldnt be purple anymore
[4:03:47] <Mtakleh> purple playing with hair is sooo cute ❤
[4:03:59] <Smartalec821> No no i mean what were you supposed to do! @purple_hs
[4:04:02] <SethCx> seems like that OTK will be way too easy to pull of
[4:04:05] <SethCx> off*
[4:04:08] <Smartalec821> oh kk, yeah giants and freeze
[4:04:11] <daidalozz> 5k gold wtf
[4:04:15] <Touillette> Rethen283 I don't see warlock/druid be something while warrior is tierA
[4:04:35] <Rethen283> @Touillette weirdly I've seen a ton of warlock/druid since they announced nerfs on rank 3/2
[4:04:44] <Touillette> oh
[4:04:46] <Mezmorizor> The priest OTK will never actually see the game. No way that 5 mana 2 card OTK that only requires a mech on board wasn't an oversight
[4:04:48] <Rethen283> but dunno why, maybe it was just a couple of weird days
[4:04:52] <thuk> @purple_hs Why don't you keep giant vs warrior?
[4:05:01] <PopeSnarky> pride100 my boi!
[4:05:02] <Touillette> well what are the true bad matchups for mage now ?
[4:05:05] <tacos32> lol lflz seared homie dressed huh defend
[4:05:14] <Rethen283> hunter should be the worst now
[4:05:21] <Rethen283> just like before, or am I wrong? o.O
[4:05:31] <sasap123> @Rethen283 why would it be?
[4:05:55] <Touillette> yeah hunter still does it, but that list seems consistent againt hunter too

[4:36:14] <CozyKittenHS> @L0rdRaiden probably not, dont remember the exact hand and board state, but the carpet means that he's got a good chance of killing both and from that position you never win
[4:36:49] <BlueMoonHS> Blue > Purple Kappa
[4:37:03] <guiletv> Your deck is on fire!
[4:37:12] <kevinschmidt1> Every once in a while I think to myself— jfc tracking is an insane card
[4:37:15] <L0rdRaiden> yea makes sense
[4:37:46] <CozyKittenHS> You need to board to win right? basically, simply not losing is not good enough in that position
[4:38:21] <CozyKittenHS> If you had a higher life total and diff cards in hand, MAYBE a diff line is possible but you really dont have time
[4:38:30] <Smartalec821> this is going swimmingly lol

[5:06:38] <dovrak1> broken cards vs rng
[5:07:04] <O_Groupie> Kill Command Twinspell good card SMOrc
[5:07:15] <bloodyfacehs> why not both?
[5:07:18] <bloodyfacehs> :)
[5:07:21] <viper__hs> we should just change grave horror to 13
[5:07:30] <CharmingRogue851> mountain giant has never been a problem though
[5:07:33] <opticpotatoop> Kill command twinspell twinspell twinspell twinspell SMOrc
[5:07:33] <peon47> They should just bring in a shittier 11-drop
[5:07:39] <BeansTea> mountain giant to hall of fame for future card design imo
[5:07:43] <wabekaHS> @purple_hs coin with pyro is pretty frustrating
[5:07:47] <peon47> Or whatever cost m giant is
[5:07:48] <mooledeye> if you nerf grave horror to 13 mana doesn't it fuck mages vs aggro
[5:07:53] <markgreenwich> does this version beat warrior? @purple_hs
[5:07:56] <phoenix1386> conjurers calling is fine cause it doesn't do anything unless you play a minion Pepega
[5:08:06] <O_Groupie> Mountain giant in even warlock, handlock
[5:08:07] <YallaYalla12> does elemental innervate stack?
[5:08:10] <cjnj193> considering we just got out of a meta where you had to be able to beat a giant on 3
[5:08:11] <Pedrantepedrante> @purple_hs what do you think about "coin does not count as a card in hand and does not activate combo" is it too much?
[5:08:12] <Bvz_> kalec > tony ?
[5:08:20] <opticpotatoop> Make coin a item instead of spell, doesn’t fix rogue but everything else
[5:08:39] <DasWolfMan> the fuck is an item
[5:08:47] <ZinjaNombie> If coin wasn't in your hand you could actually coin mountain giant PogChamp
[5:08:53] <mooledeye> coin button sounds good
[5:09:01] <YallaYalla12> does elemental innervate stack? so 4 mana discount on giants?
[5:09:08] <Kojho_DeWitt> HEy Purple altHi what do you think about the prep nerf in rogue?

[5:09:16] <mdosrobbot> yea
[5:09:38] <Pedrantepedrante> @YallaYalla12 yes, but less 2 cards in hand. Invocation is like a coin for giants

[5:38:55] <KingKongisBack> @purple_hs what replacement for Power of Creation ?
[5:39:14] <psymunn> @nickshotpye prep was nonsense, BS. it should have been nerfed 3 years ago
[5:39:16] <psymunn> it was better innervate

[5:41:15] <markymark259> rabble bounces and antonidas for warrior
[5:41:27] <markymark259> usually need the fireballs for control
[5:41:35] <MasterKillua931> anton doesnt really beat warrior
[5:41:50] <caesarow> @purple_hs why research project
[5:41:52] <markymark259> it sure helps
[5:42:22] <Berserker_81> if you run anton you need alex and then its a very different deck
