[0:05:27] <saltysandyhs> hello mr. purple. does the purple say rawr?
[0:07:02] <Xiller> Hey purple was rooting for ya :)
[0:07:09] <Decaypirate> This guys thief rogue is far from refined, I have been working on my thief rogue since release, and it wasnt even effected by nerfs.
[0:07:22] <SippShip1> new music? pog
[0:07:33] <histronic> purple what happened did Dog take his shirt off?
[0:07:36] <Xiller> 1 turn off coming back in that game
[0:07:40] <LootinHS> Why do they make you use the grey screen for grandmasters?
[0:07:40] <SippShip1> they were entertaining indeed
[0:07:44] <asherontv> asherontv subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:07:46] <SippShip1> proud of you mate
[0:07:47] <CaduSaboya> the bomb at the end was so sad lol
[0:07:50] <histronic> I missed it unfortunately
[0:07:51] <orphanedbatman> That was a really fantastic finish to that last game
[0:07:51] <Xiller> @LootinHS more professional
[0:07:55] <batieu> hi purple ! Gl for the grand master :-) french fan
[0:08:03] <nnakji> does anyone know if murloc shaman is better or miracle mage is better?
[0:08:09] <orphanedbatman> LUL
[0:08:42] <orphanedbatman> @purple_hs not only the last draw but how many of his boom bots refused to connect to face. And the one that actually did only hit for one

[0:12:24] <nat0w> Hey purple ! can you say bonjour ? (old GO fanà
[0:12:27] <nat0w> )
[0:12:40] <SippShip1> that was amazing when someone in chat said he had 10 cards during grandmasters
[0:13:02] <SippShip1> so bomb gets burned, thats why the guy gave up
[0:13:12] <ShroomiaCo> Just randomly create 4 frost novas :/
[0:13:18] <ShroomiaCo> thats how they always win against my murlocs
[0:13:21] <orphanedbatman> Not catching cards at the poker table, I need this stream to keep me from getting antsy

[0:16:45] <paru0330> @purple_hs Hey purple, came to learn how to play this deck
[0:17:48] <kingenemyy> can you add the twitch extension for the deck or code for it pls
[0:17:54] <RufasGuts> We’ll figure it out together
[0:17:58] <Bromli2000> cReAtEd By
[0:17:58] <feimda> i wanna be the very best, like no one ever was.. catch them is my real test
[0:18:06] <orphanedbatman> @purple_hs Do you think it will get better or worse after the nerfs, I know it's purely speculation but still interested to hear your take
[0:18:10] <RufasGuts> I really don’t know how to mulligan with this deck
[0:18:19] <orphanedbatman> *buffs
[0:18:26] <maximus2338> So does that make you better at the grandmaster style, or the previous competitive style?
[0:18:26] <CaptainSky> no mage no warrior pls
[0:19:01] <wyatt_hs> @purple_hs Did you ever find a list that works for the Tempo Bomb Warrior?
[0:19:09] <SippShip1> a little too humble almost but i dig it
[0:19:10] <Decaypirate> RNG "Created by" decks have always been the pinnacle of enjoyment and pain for me. Thief rogue, Thief priest, Spellfire mage.
[0:19:15] <GameDiceHS> so bad at this game
[0:19:15] <Bromli2000> Definitely makes him better at grandmaster, as long as he queues the right deck LUL
[0:20:02] <paru0330> @purple_hs do you have any tips to play this deck well
[0:20:05] <battlepants01> @purple_hs what is the strategy behind playing the apprentice on curve? Is the tempo just better than the potential of a value turn with the cyclone?
[0:20:11] <SippShip1> we're no loosers, we're givers Kappa
[0:20:24] <kingenemyy> are there more nerfs coming @purple_hs
[0:20:34] <nat0w> do you like the specialist format ?
[0:20:34] <meltingnt> sick brawl set up
[0:21:04] <orphanedbatman> Also if you're playing against an aggressive deck you really need something to contest for board
[0:21:13] <battlepants01> Cool :)

[0:21:35] <SippShip1> high expectations and lots of new investment and team

[0:40:36] <ShroomiaCo> this deck is the embodiment of what is wrong with hearthstone, literally gets entire hands created by. also generates random minions. HS cant be called a serious esport with mana cyclone being a meta card ;/
[0:41:07] <dongerinocappucin0> @purple_hs are GM league participants required to defend everything Blizzard does? 🤔
[0:41:13] <Coximus> new card PogChamp
[0:41:15] <fateos> vs warrior rather wait with giant to play it with conj on 6 or drop it asap and don't play around single target removal?
[0:41:21] <ducktrophy> i think cheating 8/8s on urn 4 is bigger issue than random generation
[0:41:41] <bitsnbights> random is fun otherwise go play chess
[0:41:42] <K_Bosta> I'd argue magic is more random. At least you get your resources every turn in HS
[0:41:57] <SippShip1> i had some configuration issues still
[0:42:01] <SippShip1> should be fixed by now
[0:42:09] <ShroomiaCo> Playing around the fourth copy of a card shouldn't be a thing.
[0:42:28] <RandomRay> hard disagree
[0:42:29] <TheRealZav> magic has the ultimate feels bad losses
[0:42:45] <dongerinocappucin0> Zalae’s reply to Zetalot’w twitter regarding the nerf to Reckless Experimenter disappointed me greatly @purple_hs
[0:42:46] <jarofheartsosrs> I think the created cards are fine adds rng and quick thinking
[0:42:48] <K_Bosta> I play magic. Every day I wish I didn't. It feels so good when you win big events, feels so fucking bad when you flood/screw (happens very frequently - you just try and play decks that mitigate one or the other)
[0:42:50] <shylixia> Increasing complexity increases skill cap imo
[0:42:51] <RufasGuts> Yeah just makes the game really one sided when someone gets mana screwed and the other doesn’t
[0:42:57] <ducktrophy> if you play around 2nd copy you are doing it wrong most of the time
[0:43:09] <Mezmorizor> A lot of magic games also delve into "who drew less mana" when neither gets screwed or flooded
[0:43:18] <tmart2323> @purple_hs I agree. i consider myself a good player and I just can't pilot that deck. I'm a noob
[0:43:29] <ShroomiaCo> I don't like having four frost novas played against me in one turn.
[0:43:31] <B_Burnz> Purple, I fell asleep (naptime) during your round against dog, how did it go?
[0:43:33] <Shrekenberg> banana lethal

[0:44:29] <tmart2323> yo purp, you have a gf?
[0:44:30] <ducktrophy> @sparkyslol he had to hex turn 5 8/8, and then turn 6 8/8 and that left another 8/8 on the board, and get through 4 taunts to hit it, no shit he did nothing
[0:44:33] <RufasGuts> Freaking poggers dude
[0:44:43] <SippShip1> Its not easy to configure your pc just about right to be both open enough for your team and being able to defend against threats
[0:44:46] <K_Bosta> magic feels like the best card game when it's good. It just has a low fuckin floor lol. I really enjoy watching purple/zalae stream HS even though I don't play anymore
[0:44:52] <dongerinocappucin0> @mrdaudy Rogue is tier 3 now. The Prep nerf was gratuitous and unnecessary.

[0:46:46] <tmart2323> MJ has been abused in way too many excellent decks over the years
[0:46:49] <ShroomiaCo> please HoF frost nova
[0:47:04] <ducktrophy> i feel some of classic set should totally stay simply coz i dont believe in blizzard to be able to replace it with their curent system
[0:47:12] <ShroomiaCo> frost nova = solitaire
[0:47:24] <dongerinocappucin0> Embrace the entropy so that individual classes are cosmetics only. Frig “class identity”!
[0:47:24] <bot_atlas> the problem is that its a basic set card so hall of faming it would be odd
[0:47:25] <ducktrophy> they would HoF fireball and print epic one
[0:47:27] <Adanine> Please Hall of Fame Angry chicken
[0:47:29] <Mezmorizor> I'm still not entirely sure why the classic set is still a thing at all

[0:48:05] <ShroomiaCo> i do not like that mage can generate random solitaire cars like frost nova. when it could generate ice blocks it was even worse
[0:48:20] <ducktrophy> not trash
[0:48:23] <Mezmorizor> Well yeah, but that's something they could change
[0:48:31] <Adanine> There's only one Fireball, essentially
[0:48:34] <Tetchcub> !code

[0:49:06] <ShroomiaCo> I think mana cyclone should be generate a random spell that did not start in your deck, that way its a little more predicatble if you understand your opponents list. prevents more than 2 copies of a card you want
[0:49:12] <ducktrophy> i really dont want them to HoF flamestrike and print 6 mana deal 5 damage Epics
[0:49:37] <Raydboul> new player can play with coins Kappa

[0:49:52] <amyzhen> BegWan
[0:49:52] <dongerinocappucin0> They’re systematically destroying the classic set so that players’ only reasonable choice will be to drop hundreds of $ on the latest expansion/s
[0:49:53] <ShroomiaCo> interactivity incoming!
[0:49:59] <saltysandyhs> they could leave basic and rotate classic
[0:50:05] <ducktrophy> @ShroomiaCo you just know there is an OTK in your idea.
[0:50:14] <yagmumru> they can play with the best card in the game 💳

[0:51:08] <ShroomiaCo> oh right hm didn't think that through
[0:51:10] <dongerinocappucin0> @yagmumru a piss poor choice for a game that’s already hemorrhaging players

[2:05:45] <SippShip1> @TheIronBun if i'd be smart and evil, i'd have college degree by now^^
[2:06:00] <TheIronBun> why evil?
[2:06:02] <kagsss> that 1/2 could be a zero one rn if oyu had hex
[2:06:37] <jacquimo_> Hhhehehe
[2:06:38] <SippShip1> i feel like a lot of the study opportunities are a waste of time

[2:07:48] <TheIronBun> @SippShip1 they aren't, they translate to cash in your pocket, a hot wife/husband, good food, a nice house, expensive vacations, early retirement, and experimental healthcare
[2:08:04] <mdosrobbot> thats spirit echo and its in wild
[2:08:05] <TheIronBun> if you work at it, that is. that's the catch
[2:08:56] <SebasCapo> He played Dr Boom, probably missclicked between the both of them
[2:09:06] <mdosrobbot> does zalae play wild?
[2:09:21] <SippShip1> @TheIronBun well, i probably cant speak for everyone, but i think there are a lot of dead ends to take into consideration
[2:09:47] <SippShip1> @TheIronBun and it takes A LOT of time still
[2:10:39] <TheIronBun> @SippShip1 the times gonna pass anyway bud
[2:10:51] <SippShip1> @TheIronBun not for me :-)

[2:12:27] <TheIronBun> @SippShip1 i tried too. i don't regret trying, i regret not trying enough and working through my medical and other issues
[2:12:47] <TheIronBun> for real, you should never regret trying. that's a homer simpson line, i swear
[2:13:12] <SippShip1> @TheIronBun I've been through a lot of issues because of trying so hard
[2:13:21] <TheIronBun> i'm getting a degree now, it's never too late
[2:13:26] <bastiodonion> i dont know much about having tried too hard
[2:13:27] <TheIronBun> just keep that in mind.
[2:13:35] <bastiodonion> but failing cuz you know you didnt try hard enough is pretty rough too
[2:14:22] <TheIronBun> well you gotta learn to forgive yourself and be in your own corner. if you sit there blaming yourself, then there's nobody in your corner at all. you have to be there for yourself
[2:14:26] <SippShip1> im not trying to win an argument here^^
[2:14:33] <TheIronBun> i'm not arguing.

[5:22:45] <anon24601> specialist format was a mistake
[5:23:05] <anon24601> like, get CRAZY with it, make the sideboards 10 slots

[5:23:15] <StreamElements> "paladin fuckin sucks, it only beats mage"
[5:23:18] <Sticowish> But ladder blows so why make it more like that?
[5:23:27] <anon24601> er like, you can choose how many cards you want to sideboard
[5:23:31] <anon24601> and which ones to sub out
[5:23:42] <anon24601> but adding that in would have to add something to the client
[5:24:05] <Decaypirate> I think Im doing it wrong, I queded mage and they have lots of 8/8s
[5:24:12] <lil_willz> You probably already talked about this, but when snip snap comes out is that just gonna be an insta include in this deck or no?
[5:24:13] <anon24601> and that would take four hours of work, and would make the UI have a little more clutter, so of course that's haram for team five
[5:24:19] <Xxxraixx> probably make it like up to 7-8 cards diff for side decks might be better

[5:29:52] <rappmupp> thanks
[5:29:58] <YallaYalla12> copy it into clipboard, create new deck in hearthstone, a popup should appear
[5:30:01] <ar_WUBWUB> it completes it and tells you what cards you're missing if any
[5:30:17] <tom89071> NO DR BOOM??
[5:30:23] <dansanity1990> what do you think about 1 omega?
[5:30:40] <Touillette> no boom
[5:30:59] <kingpinball> bomb hunter doesnt seem that good tbh it feels like they need galvanizer
[5:31:08] <edwaudo> i dont think this deck needs jepehto to win
[5:31:22] <amyzhen> Thts my brother haha
[5:31:40] <Touillette> edwaudo socut jepetto and hit 249 legend :)
[5:32:01] <simplyy19> lol no hero card??
[5:32:21] <iTichuu> Whats the point of jepetto in this deck can someone explain me?
[5:32:43] <Touillette> draw, have low cost mana cards that you can easily duplicate with barista
[5:32:52] <m4t3oj> to play a meme card on ladder
[5:32:57] <iTichuu> @Touillette ok thanks
[5:33:04] <YallaYalla12> to draw boom more often
[5:33:06] <ar_WUBWUB> most of your minions are battlecries, 1 mana powerful battlecries are nice, we like them
[5:33:23] <Touillette> oh no chat is becoming an average retarded twitch chat NotLikeThis
[5:33:48] <kingpinball> that happens at 1500 viewers
[5:33:50] <iTichuu> @Touillette thats including you too tho LUL
[5:34:11] <Touillette> iTichuu i guess so
[5:34:15] <simplyy19> why doesn't he play the hero card in this deck? @chat
[5:34:21] <Touillette> no
[5:34:36] <Touillette> do you see it in the decklist at the right side of the screen ?
[5:34:47] <rekhet2> @simplyy19 because its trash
[5:34:56] <Sticowish> @simplyy19 7 mana do nothing
[5:35:14] <To512> poor streamers :(
[5:35:25] <iTichuu> @Touillette he asked why tho LOL
[5:35:41] <TheRealZav> definitely need to cut something for second 5/5 bomber
[5:35:41] <Touillette> the idea of the deck is to be agressive, not to win the lategame
[5:35:42] <simplyy19> what? at least rush to trade immediately?
[5:35:47] <m4t3oj> @Touillette do you see his question?
[5:35:55] <Touillette> iTichuu I have to be retarded to fit the chat standard :)
[5:36:00] <anon24601> I would sub but I'm broke phi broke, dad
[5:36:01] <YallaYalla12> argent commander on 6
[5:36:03] <simplyy19> @Touillette you should read the question ;)
[5:36:04] <dansanity1990> this deck is drawing well. liking the synergy
[5:36:04] <iTichuu> @Touillette haHHA
[5:36:09] <lil_willz> @purple_hs Is barista just for late game value?

[5:36:49] <bluntcrumb> @Firebat do you deck doctor wild decks
[5:36:58] <SebasCapo> @Touillette You're a bad and mean person, stop you bad man
[5:36:58] <dansanity1990> do u think 2 omega is neccessary?

[5:41:01] <Touillette> not listening a retired world champion FeelsBadMan
[5:41:14] <Zeophen> HS18Gold
[5:41:18] <gw_coast> zilliax better yeah
[5:41:20] <greekgodbg> why is the stream so laggyyyy
[5:41:22] <javrous> if you think about it... what really is the number 7?
[5:41:42] <hotehjrjr> Definitely seems right to boom there tbh
[5:41:53] <South_North> its infinitely bigger than 0
[5:42:02] <shikts1> press 1 for boom and 2 for pepsi boom
[5:42:15] <South_North> infinitely times better*
[5:42:27] <South_North> *bigger
[5:43:19] <gw_coast> this rogue didn't get the memo EleGiggle
[5:43:39] <edwaudo> nerfs dont hurt rogue that much
[5:43:53] <gw_coast> ofc it hurts a lot
[5:43:56] <ImRhinne> they need to buff warrior more EleGiggle
[5:44:14] <SebasCapo> imagine if all warrior mechs had rush
[5:44:17] <SebasCapo> that would be fucking broken
[5:44:24] <ImRhinne> imagine if all mechs had rush
[5:44:28] <GenpoDosKy> @edwaudo have you ever played hearthstone in your life?
[5:44:28] <YallaYalla12> militia commander should have overkill: shuffle a bomb
[5:44:33] <ImRhinne> and u could draw 3 of them for 1 mana
[5:44:43] <ImRhinne> and u wouldnt thin your deck out
[5:44:44] <gw_coast> at least the tempo deck
[5:45:04] <edwaudo> yah this ner wasnt as bad as blade fury nerf

[5:54:33] <dansanity1990> how do u qualify to be a grandmaster
[5:54:56] <pastaacz> mage is so much rng meanwhile warrior just shuffles bomb and hopes to rng god so his opponent draws it
[5:55:02] <Rehio> You can read the article on "How Grandmaster works" on the Hearthstone website.
