[1:49:45] <NothgingIsChange> no dust for buffed card Kappa
[1:49:47] <Hungery13ear> Why would there be?
[1:49:58] <sennec> why do people think you get dust for buffed cards
[1:50:21] <Hungery13ear> If by same logic as nerfing cards, they would take dust away
[1:50:56] <bda01> the logic would be ppl dusted those cards because they werent good at that time
[1:51:12] <Echigoyaa> I dont mind. I got 1600 for a golden prep
[1:51:19] <sennec> riiiiight
[1:51:20] <az_agoston> i mean.. u wont be able to use some of them in odd or even decks..
[1:51:36] <Hungery13ear> I think the logic behind giving full refund for nerfed cards is that since you're getting less value, you have the option of getting your investment back
[1:51:40] <az_agoston> so its a nerf in a way
[1:51:54] <Hungery13ear> Only in wild, in which case Blizzard frankly does not care about
[1:52:07] <sennec> bit of a stretch imo

[3:14:03] <brballer42> Roguestone was more fun.
[3:14:05] <ducktrophy> dunno, more cards meant that you could fuck around more with t2-3 shit, top tier meta will always be trash in HS

[3:15:04] <real_pepega> just w8 for pogo buff LUL its gonna be fun
[3:15:15] <ducktrophy> also almost all best decks have deathknights anyways, so i feel lik eit would be more fair if Uther Jaina and guldan still existed
[3:15:28] <ducktrophy> to match Boom and Hagatha and Zuljin bullshit
[3:15:30] <brballer42> Yeah the pogo buff is good enough that Warrior/Mage/Hunter are going to be the only classes played.

[3:16:31] <kingpinball> khadgar your 4 drop, youll get good ones promise
[3:16:47] <ducktrophy> my main source of frustration on ladder is that aggro has basically infinite reload. It's NOT healthy for the game for aggro deck to be able to survive getting board cleared turn after turn and still make full boards

[4:04:05] <DFWeedington> @SasendoHS lots of people are playing hunter to counter mage
[4:04:42] <DFWeedington> @SasendoHS otherwise i've also found deathrattle mech hunter to be really strong

[5:04:24] <knotastalker> I learn things here
[5:04:36] <davidgeek> chuuu are you ok
[5:04:36] <BING_TTBB> I learn how to play off meta decks
[5:04:39] <PrincV> and pride comes with prejudice
[5:04:40] <BING_TTBB> like bomb warrior
[5:04:47] <Chuuu> @davidgeek yesu
[5:04:49] <cjnj193> i mean its better than zalae zap
[5:04:53] <exrotes> So what're the odds on Blizzard fixing Snip Snap before it gets released and priest just otk's everyone
[5:04:56] <sneaky_cardshark> The hero we need not the one we deserve
[5:05:07] <BING_TTBB> @exrotes 0
[5:05:17] <TheRealZav> priest wont just otk everyone
[5:05:26] <praxton> bad channel !! iam out
[5:05:28] <PokerJoker811> I'm looking forward to the 75% Warrior play rate in all regions of GM after the buffs.
[5:05:28] <Chuuu> @davidgeek you dont like the idea? BibleThump
[5:05:46] <shade572_> hi @purple_hs
[5:05:52] <exrotes> @TheRealZav snipsnap + reckless experimenter + any mech already on board is basically infinite damage
[5:05:56] <juwon22> !rogue
[5:05:57] <StreamElements> definitely not lackey rogue lmao
[5:05:58] <exrotes> limited only by click speed
[5:06:05] <sneaky_cardshark> Is this hits from the 2010's? OMEGALUL
[5:06:08] <davidgeek> @Chuuu a+ for effort
[5:06:21] <shade572_> @purple_hs whats your playlist? i love everysong u play :3
[5:06:22] <TheRealZav> good luck drawing that all the time and sticking minions against hunters
[5:06:35] <r0m4n0m> is there a reasonable alternative to antonidas in this deck?
[5:06:37] <shade572_> !playlist
[5:06:38] <StreamElements> try !song
[5:06:41] <shade572_> !song
[5:06:41] <StreamElements> Google the lyrics Kappa
[5:06:41] <StreamElements> @shade572_ failed to get the current song.
[5:06:47] <shade572_> T_T
[5:07:08] <shade572_> the bot is bulling me
[5:07:28] <actuated69> @TheRealZav you can tutor the snipsnap and there is the stealth 4 drop mech
[5:07:30] <nosecandy> is bomb warrior worth crafting?
[5:07:40] <TheRealZav> you have to do both
[5:07:56] <exrotes> who cares if it's unreliable it's still a 5 mana play that can kill anyone from any life total if they arent taunted up
[5:08:01] <TheRealZav> and the stealth gets deadly shot
[5:08:20] <exrotes> outplaying infinite damage for a few turns is irrelevant because it's infinite damage
[5:08:22] <TheRealZav> youre the one who said priest is gonna farm everyone. it wont happen.
[5:09:04] <exrotes> because it will
[5:09:18] <Cartmanplayz> i like the sp00n version more xD
[5:09:25] <blockedcorn386> purple how do u get that thing that shows your deck??? @purple_hs
[5:09:36] <exrotes> hunter being amazing and sometimes countering it and hoping they burn fast enough to not die to the combo isnt a counter

[5:11:31] <Bobsley_> thanks
[5:11:44] <orphanedbatman> @therealzav I'm not picking either side I'm more of a wait and see but deadly shot is not enough of an argument to shut down the combo potential imo

[5:12:08] <ItachiUchiha782> !(classname) Kappa
[5:12:08] <StreamElements> i recommend you uninstall Hearthstone
[5:12:13] <TheRealZav> it's stupid to say one combo is gonna bust metas when people will counter that shtit.
[5:12:59] <orphanedbatman> The combo is flexible, you don't have to have the stealth minion stick, just any mech period at any point in the game
[5:13:09] <exrotes> @TheRealZav stop saying infinite damage on turn 5 is ok
[5:13:25] <exrotes> just because sometime one deck gets to counter it
[5:13:27] <PokerJoker811> "The bombs don't matter, we're not gonna draw all three" is exactly what you say before you get on Trolden.
