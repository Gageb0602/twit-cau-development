[0:12:52] <Lumonyx_> The mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms. The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek ŒºŒØœÑŒøœÇ, mitos, "thread", and œáŒøŒΩŒ¥œÅŒØŒøŒΩ, chondrion, "granule" or "grain-like". Mitochondria generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy. A mitochondrion is thus termed the powerhouse of the cell.
[0:12:54] <nave20051> @captinnoscopezz this is because low elo don‚Äôt know to play every champion so they lost a lot... like Akali she is so broken but has low win rate because low elo sucks and don‚Äôt know play

From what Werlyb said on stream it also felt like he & the rest of the team weren't really close while it seemed that Sacre clicked just right in. I do personally think Scare is slightly better than Werlyb, and if SK wanted to give a chance to someone from the academy team Sacre was the best choice.
