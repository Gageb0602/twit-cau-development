[0:03:25] <The_Red_Emperor> I'm really confident that we'll be the way better bot lane. (Laughs) I see games where G2's bot lane is 100 CS down, losing tower, and getting killed 2 vs 2. I can't remember any games like that for us. CoreJJ and I don't make many mechanical mistakes and I think we play a lot cleaner in general. -- Doublelift 2019

[0:11:44] <Sophia291> @g2perkz did carlos give you the drawing yet? I also just posted drawing of wunder
[0:11:45] <Gatcan> As an European it was always hard for me to understand American culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after G2 vs TL I finally understand it. NA is just so fucking free.

[2:18:22] <Gatcan> As an European it was always hard for me to understand American culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after G2 vs TL I finally understand it. NA is just so fucking free.

[3:50:48] <invisiblewomeen> @saifui He is waiting for some offers from LEC. If he don't have that he just wait and look for the spring
[3:50:50] <Klepto90> jg gets to influence the early game like no other role and then scale like a solo laner, really balanced
[3:50:57] <serbarristan2nd> Double bruiser/mage botlane meta was better than this shit
[3:51:00] <Caarim> Damn MSI is useless LUL
[3:51:03] <Dadabibo123> @g2perkz do you miss playing midlane?
[3:51:08] <Kalmarunionen_GTX> @Aryze_TB I think the last thing on his mind is leaving the team that has given him everything in his career, which is now the best team in the world, debatably.
[3:51:13] <kocunar1960> who has worse vietnam flashbacks, g2 or USA LUL
[3:51:14] <W4lleetv> all the good players must be playing reksai
[3:51:17] <basstime> perkz is suffering from the msi debuff
[3:51:26] <basstime> all his energy went into winning the title
[3:51:41] <souledger> that kill right there reminds me of zven on kog getting killed by Ambition on Khazix
[3:51:48] <basstime> now me must struggle and lose the split so he can store enough energy to win worlds
[3:51:51] <Kalmarunionen_GTX> @g2perkz How likely is it you go 0-2 in the first week?
[3:52:00] <basstime> just read the script Riot prepared
[3:52:01] <Aryze_TB> @Kalmarunionen_GTX i'm not saying he's leaving, just interested if he actually still prefers mid over ad

[4:44:13] <dimmituqualenome> what was he talking about?
[4:44:15] <silentechooo> @hinkelboy I think TL finals it was a lot of things that made it so one sided. For once I think TL overperformed vs IG so many people got hyped way too much. Also everyone on G2 was feeling it that day and TL was just scared. Peak TL vs peak G2 is a lot closer, but I still think g2 takes is probably 3/1

[5:21:56] <MayoBrain> Perkz, I'll give you an honest opinion. I think Rekkles has to learn from you, the way you connect with the people and your fans is something he lacks. He has been the most popular eu player by far but still he has very little social life. it's understandable he doesn't want to expose too much, but still, having you making content is so enjoyable and lovely. thanks.
