[3:54:34] <ekkogunbladeonly> @g2perkz Let's think how good is G2. IG get 9-1 in groups. SKT T1 won against IG. TL won 3-1 in BO5 against IG. G2 won 3-2 in BO5 against SKT T1 and stomp TL in final 3-0. G2 is unstoppable and imposible to win against them. That's how good is EU now. Thanks G2 so I can be proud of my region. #G2ARMY4EVER
