[0:10:20] <Azircze> I think they will win, loke carlos said, they can play whatever they want and it works :D also perkz has a big advantage of beings able to play other champs, not only marskmans, but also every midlane champ :D
[0:10:36] <satatardy> Playing off meta champs doesn't magically make you win
[0:10:47] <satatardy> Maybe a couple Bo1s but that's it
[0:11:05] <Azircze> it doesn't have to be off meta
