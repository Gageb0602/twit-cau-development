[1:18:12] <atricdruid> @Vader isnt it better hitting stores?
[1:18:13] <ShazerGaming> @Vader the money in it goes up. so if been hit recently it's shit money
[1:18:14] <AdonaiElohime> lol so many banks getting robbed right now, police cant handle it

[1:20:23] <s_m9> Bleach, which is essentially chlorine dissolved in water, is not a flammable substance on its own. If mixed with certain materials such as ammonia or acetylene, it can become unstable, forming explosive compounds or reactions.

[3:08:56] <Hxail> @Vader what abou robbing that dude behind bank possible Card?//
[3:08:57] <death0fAstrawberry> ziggyjKnife widepeepoHappy Let me K-niff you a question chat
[3:08:58] <Jugggiler> Dundee @sebtaa
[3:08:59] <abirvalgo> @Vader there are no key binds for usual commands? (like answer, hangup etc)
[3:09:00] <Rdm95ok> they will be worht when you egt cards tho
[3:09:00] <Brownoustown> NOT IN TOWN
[3:09:01] <kaldira> Dab got like 500 from one of them today
[3:09:01] <Smunchnu> @Vader I think when you get into the back of the bank is when it becomes worth it
[3:09:04] <potatomanyeehaw> you havent learned how to do the back area though
[3:09:05] <sebtaa> Thanks guys
[3:09:09] <Heartsome_NaNa> @death0fAstrawberry monkaW
[3:09:10] <killabkylt> Hey @Vader what did you end up doing with the Mustang?
[3:09:10] <Dxfighter> The vaults are worth it but you need to get the cards first
[3:09:13] <Lonlhish> You can get 225 chains in one thing
[3:09:14] <getsouled> You could get someone to run away when the cops show up
[3:09:15] <jamiei543> that was just getting in the door you still have to do the register thats never gonna happen in town
[3:09:16] <chickparmxtraparm> The ones out of town have yet to have cops arrive
[3:09:19] <TranDevil> i heard money im sry is outta context..im drunk
[3:09:22] <BeerMe625> have to get into the back
[3:09:24] <charizopi> Vaults are worth it
[3:09:28] <goddamitsteve> Maybe in civ cars?
[3:09:33] <AtteTheBear> @Vader Are you sure they came there because of the lockpick, and not the fist fight
[3:09:36] <moby1kanobee> i bet Sun Moon will know how in less than 24 hours lmao
[3:09:36] <ncsu_riggs> hold up the tellers @Vader ?
[3:09:38] <sherminator011> can make 50k
[3:09:40] <riz23> Amazon
[3:09:41] <kaashe> is it possible to get the cards??
[3:09:41] <Signothorn> Would it be worth it to distract cops to other areas so you can rob the banks?
[3:09:42] <xelich> jesus will be the first to do it and tell everyone how to
[3:09:44] <Fruub> maybe you have to rob the vault to get the key cards Kappa

I can't believe your channel has blown up this much, I'm seriously super happy for you. I think you had like 800-ish followers when I found you, and I knew it was gonna work out.

[6:56:51] <0minim> LAX is the big one I think
[6:56:51] <pisstachios> @Vader SD airport is small. LAX is the hub for the southwestern US for international flights.

[6:56:52] <BetterThanTofu> San Diego is shit
[6:56:53] <lepacaJQ> probably better off landing NY

[6:56:57] <AttackonLoL> SD IS EXPENSIVE
[6:56:57] <oooohmoussasissoko> Why are you going there?
[6:56:57] <kostonn> The city is sprawling huge, not really huge in the literal sense @Vader
[6:56:58] <Zosimoto> @Vader no it's not super small. don't listen to these clowns. it's bigger than a commuter, smaller than like LAX or SFO
[6:56:58] <4reader> yeah everyone usually goes to LAX
[6:56:58] <maerrik> LAX and SFO have more international flights

[6:57:13] <doze_pdx> San Diego is not an international hub like LAX

[6:57:13] <pbrsponsored> @drcolossus_59 Cringe excuse bro. Cringe excuse.
[6:57:14] <bwilliebigsilly> @Vader it’s fairly small for a city but there’s 2 terminals

[6:57:24] <Jeps__> Did you say if you were streaming in the USA?
[6:57:25] <br4nd13> John Wayne airport = superior

[6:57:51] <Blarbicus> what about the atm?
[6:57:52] <ishavedmyharrypotter> SD likes to pretend it's a big city because of the population but that's just because the city limits are HUGE.

[7:53:18] <Exempt_Instinct> bank was open for business
[7:53:19] <Rudaan> nothing illegal about the entry tho
[7:53:20] <theghosttv_> Illegally entering a habitable structure with the intent to commit a crime.
[7:53:22] <OPWILLY> wrong charge lul
[7:53:25] <wazz3h> The bank is open so it isn't illegal entry

[8:10:07] <Sierra_____> you should have represented yourself
[8:10:13] <jamiei543> the other charge didnt fit either you was in a public area
[8:10:15] <rdshea3> all it takes is an impulse from Koil for internal affairs
[8:10:16] <cjb46290> whats with the cup
[8:10:16] <BagelRacer> only one LUL
[8:10:16] <edwinflee> i like the idea that cops have to do guard duty
[8:10:17] <Thunderfistr> they couldnt really do burgry either
[8:10:17] <EpicGene> Yeah U Got Fooked
[8:10:17] <beezleblob> DA should be a villian to both sides not just crims and friendly with cops
[8:10:21] <kulezerolive> @Vader You should make a lawyer character
[8:10:25] <FartSauna> cops don't get fired in real life for killing innocent unarmed people. so this is all spot on unfortunately
[8:10:25] <IridescentGlimmer> @CybernatonEvolution one cop got fired for shooting another cop in the head
[8:10:26] <Edko100> cheer100 pick a number 1 or 2!!!
[8:10:27] <Tarrenel> union dues should pay for an officers lawyer
[8:10:29] <DominantBlaze> Nora didnt point out the bank door was still locked to the cops at all.. kind of a key point
[8:10:30] <Eagleone98> what did it take for that person to get suspended?

[8:14:00] <MrHilaro> @212phantom dont go to other channels and BabyRage
[8:14:00] <OranHexthief> you could demand the officers involved go through mandatory retraining. ie: no solo patrol etc. vader
[8:14:02] <brewballzz> so after something like that, after you've been booked.. do the cops tell the lawyer.. hey.. this is what you could have said to help Eugene in order to help the lawyer improve?
[8:14:02] <shanabanana25> @Edko100 Pog

[8:15:45] <Gatzarlok> A lot of characters don't really care much for how much cash they have anyways.
[8:15:45] <Thlite_Lithp> confirmed edko ceo of bittyco
[8:15:47] <Grump__> @mesmonk 45 mins I believe
[8:15:47] <j0ycelyn> what's the time for you right now?
[8:15:47] <beezleblob> @Vader problem is people rather not appeal because they need to get into main server after court again and thats harsh
[8:15:47] <Settles32> vadeP
[8:15:53] <gashnal> there would be less trivial court cases if cops took the rp seriously.
[8:15:54] <Plaxorous> There is no punishment for Cops what Vader is getting at. The system which is there is hardly ever implemented.
[8:15:54] <MrHilaro> @212phantom id avoid it in the future, Vader doesnt like people going to other channels like that, no streamer likes it

[8:16:30] <Grump__> @fastfoodguru Attempted Robbery,
[8:16:32] <212phantom> @mrhilaro yeah i know it was totally innocent though
[8:16:32] <probablymylastlogin> @VerityNS im mostly just trolling because the actual level of proof at the ground level is things like probable cause and reasonable suspicion. it likely was up to him to prove it was his IN THE MOMENT, but the ultimate burden is on the government in court to show it ISNT his "beyond a shadow of a doubt" (which is just popular phrasing and not quite the exact standard)
[8:16:35] <Benji30> Cops needed to be treated as their characters and not cops - adding incorrect charges should be seen as something that gets you suspended.
