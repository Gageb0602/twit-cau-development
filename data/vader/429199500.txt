[0:41:50] <jaredkaragen> ok, i must have missed it when i clicked over... ty ;
[0:41:51] <Imp_Releaser> time slot is associated with random card color
[0:41:52] <Mancomb_Seepgud> yeah otherwise it would just say 8-18
[0:41:52] <Leemann> what about a new outfit???
[0:41:55] <Olarto> you need like 30 different cards then @Vader
[0:41:56] <gramz> the card # changes every day
[0:41:57] <Killsauce> its because each time slot randomly picks a card
[0:41:58] <Firewindwgames> You don‚Äôt even have the card on you
[0:42:00] <cruciare2750> Whats up grandpa
[0:42:01] <ShaydsTheRogue> might be a typo
[0:42:01] <yodankbroo> Bank does not matter
[0:42:01] <hamci_4> ?????????
[0:42:02] <shotguntommmyy> i think the back numbers are the numbers on the map when you scroll thru
[0:42:03] <dirmex> exactly
[0:42:04] <ViisionLFT> its cuz they randomize
[0:42:04] <Big_Bev> its randomly generated
[0:42:04] <CrusadersWrath15> @jaredkaragen no problem :)
[0:42:05] <Smunchnu> vadeH hmmmm
[0:42:05] <imnopolarbear> Because the time slot is assigned differently every day, isn't it?
[0:42:05] <thetotalenigma> Summit and jesus got the wild card
[0:42:07] <anthonymayow> @Vader does the time slots and cards move per day?
[0:42:08] <BuilderAtWork> D:
[0:42:09] <apitos> they change daily
[0:42:09] <bezerker08> ????????????
[0:42:11] <Fishnet83> @FromBoraBora you alright buddy? hope you realize people will come in all day asking so if it¬¥s annoying you alright you better stop reading chat xD
[0:42:13] <ervindjk> no
[0:42:15] <ImFamou5> not card number
[0:42:15] <pmalone96> probably random every day so you can't learn it off @vader
[0:42:16] <Finalbawze> You basically get charged with the same thing as big bank might as well risk it there instead of wasting time with small ones
[0:42:17] <hurtzyou09> Ramdom everyday
[0:42:19] <Dxfighter> You have to decrypt everyday
[0:42:19] <ViisionLFT> the time slots corrosponding car id change every day
[0:42:20] <wopperheim> Changes everyday
[0:42:20] <eglethal> if they were the same every day cops learn the time though they could just camp the banks
[0:42:21] <sarcoemus> @vader the card numbers never change
[0:42:23] <ImFamou5> only yime slots changes card nubers
[0:42:23] <4692dreamer> no they don't
[0:42:24] <Asset> 5 different time slots, you have to use the correct card correlated with the time slot. Dab knows what he is doing, lol.
[0:42:26] <renale> different time slots different cards
[0:42:28] <thachildishone> Gonna be another three hours b4 they hit the bank
[0:42:29] <DamnDanny> @Wipz Hey man LUL

[0:42:36] <FromBoraBora> @Fishnet83 i dont stay for long dont worry, i just stay for the bullshit that happens at the start
[0:42:37] <AtteTheBear> 6 small banks, not 5
[0:42:45] <Fishnet83> @FromBoraBora Fair enough :)
[0:42:46] <LeonGGX_> ????
[0:42:47] <AsiganX> Cause it's randomly generated

[0:42:48] <The_Reaper_719> @Fishnet83 can you dab 4Head
[0:42:49] <bazrob87> 6 small
[0:42:50] <AtteTheBear> 8 total banks minus paleto and vault
[0:42:51] <Singapurr> ????
[0:42:51] <LeonGGX_> im confused af
[0:42:52] <Xyr0_22> @Vader the timeslot card id correlation changes every day but the cards stay the same so you just need to know which card is which id
[0:42:52] <AsiganX> and not truncated
[0:42:54] <NIXXSAXX> and how are they supposed to figure this shit out without using meta LUL
[0:42:59] <4li3n> Pog
[0:42:59] <MrSox> if you go by what Dab is saying and you figure out what card color = number, youll be able to know when and what card you use later on @Vader
[0:43:01] <Cliiquuee> Is there even 5 small banks?
[0:43:01] <bruchainz> This whole system is Pepega
[0:43:03] <sugarloww> It's a coincidence

[1:29:14] <BlackMerzyz> @Quinzz Atleast remove the fucking tactical scope, that's what bothers me. Cause there is no way for crims to have scopes.
[1:29:14] <NIXXSAXX> only like 1 cop should be able to respond to the small banks
[1:29:14] <m4b0sch> @BlackMerzyz Well they are Class 2, and AR's are class 3.. Cops should just only be able to use the same class that the criminals are using

[1:29:34] <ShaydsTheRogue> shootouts are not a small thing.
[1:29:34] <TurboPaulie> would be interesting if they could onlly use a weapon large enough based on situation like robery from store to powerplant
[1:29:34] <OldGlory> yea but get arrested and rip 20k but police dont run out of ARs
[1:29:34] <lowj97> Guess the play is to lock pick and hide from now on
[1:29:35] <GodUsopp___> not worth it FailFish
[1:29:36] <apems> you would of gotten away if it wasnt for the scuff

[1:29:40] <atexih> cheking for pulse btw
[1:29:40] <that80sguy> they should have designated shooters for AR Duty rest on smg and shotguns
[1:29:41] <rxmorph85> @Vader I thought Snow said the cops replace cars if scuff happens
[1:29:41] <BigCatTeeter> Hostage just in case might be the move.
[1:29:41] <BrockGrimes> @Vader Why did they fire on you?
[1:29:42] <Mancomb_Seepgud> If it wasn't for the bloody scuff
[1:29:42] <gigantes25> It‚Äôs not worth it.
[1:29:43] <Leemann> caused for poor planning..npoor planning equals death
[1:29:43] <shotguntommmyy> the AR needs addressed

[1:30:13] <cronbat> ARs should only be for SWAT needs when they have to enter the bank after you. but being able to get it at any point is too OP

[1:30:44] <absalon1337> @Konges People complain when their streamer loses and fail to understand cops bring out AR's in retaliation. People don't care about how to fix the situation because to fix it their streamers would have to stop using class 2's and blasting cops every time they get the chance
[1:30:44] <kodyy21> Are they even allowed to have 6 cops?
[1:30:47] <Joshfs9> Ayaya
[1:30:47] <atricdruid> @SoftSwear its for a 5k robbery theyre treating it like the main vault

[1:30:57] <m4b0sch> @Vader What about a rule that makes cop only able to use same class weapon as the criminals. So no AR's versus Shotguns or SMG's ..
[1:30:58] <TehTano> You can have 6 cops if 1 is a cadet
[1:30:58] <JustPlainDK> no one die to scuff this time. people died to invisible dog last time

[1:31:15] <ItsMsy> @Gaawdz the issue with AK is that it costs like 35k, while cops get their rifles without paying anything. 35k is way too much to risk for everyone, even more if you're risking additional items during larger robberies

[2:20:09] <Rhudson1987> @vader they assume that he didnt shoot, but they can assume that just because you were in a bank they can take all of your money because you were in a bank
[2:20:10] <apems> yeah small banks not worth it
[2:20:12] <HotChocolate_> i think she is roleplaying a debt to dab as well because the kidnapping thing as well

[2:21:15] <mihex123> he only shot at car
[2:21:18] <Hurraaahhhhh> @soderhoolm if anything, speedy is guilty of fewer crimes... police dont itemize how many different cops you shot at when you are involved in an aggravated robbery... you put everyone present in danger
[2:21:18] <Tiessiet> hi chat peepoHappy

[2:21:20] <Mr_Jhin4> @Vader nex time give up and get a 1500 fine LULW
[2:21:20] <Srsli> 3 day holds are shit..
[2:21:24] <Exonifier> i think youre better off doing the registers solo or sending your group to different banks at the same time
[2:21:24] <Octoberfist94> 3x 1st degree monkaW
[2:21:31] <M4tjesf1let> speedy is getting so much shit the last few days LUL
[2:21:32] <youngcheeze> @sucarcus the bad cops here and there make me sad
[2:21:33] <Darkblood935> @HonorNecris Dab was gonna pay 5k, Slim upped it to 10
[2:21:35] <yelsneH> Analblaster murdered speedy the other day LUL
[2:21:37] <mfnorcross17> 100% premeditated

[2:21:53] <Darkblood935> @yelsneH Dab blasted him in the back with a shotgun last night
[2:21:53] <Dareach> he got shot already before dab
[2:21:55] <iambobsushi> Time left?
[2:21:56] <Dxfighter> Anal got shot down by guards too
[2:21:57] <Withdra> In the medical area guard shot him too
[2:21:58] <MomusTheGreat> Gee imagine Eugene being in prison again
[2:21:59] <gameoftwohalves> @Vader what you in jail for now >? lol
[2:22:03] <chbobsy> watch me tho
[2:22:03] <pearjuice> Slim in in the infirmary
[2:22:03] <M4tjesf1let> hostage = security against scuffnes
[2:22:07] <TaintedHoney> Can't the cops lock the door again like they can in other banks?
[2:22:09] <HonorNecris> @Darkblood935 gotcha, how much was Speedy's fine? What does he net from it?
[2:22:09] <Gimopimo> just tuned in, what happened? lol
[2:22:10] <chbobsy> hi
[2:22:15] <cheddybits> Really though you would have got away if the car wasn't scuffed
[2:22:21] <yelsneH> what triggers the guards to shoot you in prison wtf?
[2:22:21] <chbobsy> anyone still play red dead
[2:22:22] <atricdruid> @Vader or leave after lockpicking and come back for the cash later
[2:22:24] <Darkblood935> @HonorNecris no idea
[2:22:25] <sweet_nothingz> how long is 60 months?
[2:22:25] <Skadingle> Just got back how long did he get?
[2:22:25] <OverRobbie> does he still have his gun license
[2:22:25] <jamesbrave1> The cops are treating it as normal bank robberies it seems.
[2:22:27] <tricker321> how much time is taken off for jobs
[2:22:29] <kostonn> Off to an exciting start today LUL
[2:22:31] <chbobsy> is this live
[2:22:32] <ancientants> @Vader Did you figure out what you can do with the security card form cash register you found yesterday?
[2:22:35] <Nocnybober> @sweet_nothingz 60 minutes
[2:22:35] <putinsdaughter93> @chbobsy robbery gone bad
[2:22:35] <Toplay92> @chbobsy me
[2:22:38] <chbobsy> i mean gat was a long time ago
[2:22:38] <lulo890> @vader whate are you gonna do whane you are out of jeal
[2:22:42] <dr_awde> fucking falling every time LUL
[2:22:46] <apems> think you make more money from the Jewlery Store and its quicker too
[2:22:48] <jamiei543> the back vault seems u have no chance of getting into
[2:22:48] <MasterRamRod> I think the lockpick warning should sound after the door opens imo
[2:22:51] <putinsdaughter93> @tricker321 4min
[2:22:51] <sweet_nothingz> @Nocnybober thank ye
[2:22:51] <geace> any plans of getting on your reporter character to comment the race? @Vader
[2:22:53] <asap_puffed> KOIL SAID IN BETWEEN JEWELRY STORE AND VAULT IF YOU GET IN BACK
[2:22:53] <chbobsy> also what kind of character is this
[2:22:54] <WEEmanLITTLE> @Vader has anyone gotten in the back yet?
[2:22:54] <yelsneH> why did the prison guards shoot dab @Vader ?
[2:22:54] <rebnexk677> @chbobsy Dead game now
[2:22:57] <randy_randy_> @Vader When Dab and Slim were down, if you had been quiet... acted dead... cops would've come in (in shotgun range)... maybe?
[2:23:06] <ClumsyHybrid> how much did he get chat?
[2:23:08] <ancientants> @Vader Did you figure out what you can do with the security card form cash register you found yesterday??
[2:23:09] <Decoe_> @Vader you don't have to shot tho
[2:23:09] <MasterRamRod> The warning is far too soon for the time it takes to lockpick and loot
[2:23:09] <HonorNecris> @Darkblood935 If Eugene's fine was over 7k, I wonder what Speedy's was
[2:23:10] <Pyrewyrm> That small bank is worse than the vault, with less profit
[2:23:11] <Rambino_LFC> The back is better than jewelry
[2:23:11] <billiebobbo> dont bring guns, if you get shot sue the hell out of em
[2:23:11] <maurices161293> 60
[2:23:13] <putinsdaughter93> @geace tuong
[2:23:15] <Nocnybober> @clumsyhybrid 60
[2:23:16] <chbobsy> k well i tried to come make friends but ok
[2:23:17] <shotguntommmyy> shorter time to get in door and register
[2:23:19] <sweet_nothingz> @Vader are prison breaks possible?
[2:23:21] <ClumsyHybrid> alright ty
[2:23:26] <sleventyeleven> the guards only shot the people who have done jail breaks lol
[2:23:29] <FireBird76> Why did the guards shoot dab? @vader
[2:23:30] <Skadingle> FiveM Is multiple instances of single player synced up not a multi mod so it gets fucked up a lot
[2:23:32] <chbobsy> i do funny shit
[2:23:34] <A_Superstar> Jenny was confused when Speedy arrived on the scene as they though tit was 4 inside @Vader
[2:23:36] <apems> no one knows how to do the back yet so jewlery is better for now
[2:23:40] <xiamrs> just find schofield
[2:23:42] <ancientants> @Vader Did you figure out what you can do with the security card from cash register you found yesterday?
[2:23:43] <CarlMarshal> apart from speedy PepeHands
[2:23:43] <sweet_nothingz> @Vader besides speedy
[2:23:47] <WaterproofMan> How do you do a prison break?
[2:23:51] <dr_awde> @Vader Apparently they are easier if you take some EMS hostage LUL
[2:23:51] <FearThePoodle> Can they take your phone in jail?
[2:23:52] <tteach_tv> @Vader It was 4 because of SPEEDY
[2:23:55] <corywillis21> chang broke out
[2:23:56] <chbobsy> ResidentSleeper
[2:23:59] <GodUsopp___> prison break easy
[2:24:05] <Withdra> @FearThePoodle since the chang thing i dont think they can
[2:24:05] <Prownedacc> @tteach_tv inside not outside
[2:24:08] <youngcheeze> @tteach_tv obviously bud
[2:24:10] <almighty_jens> how much time?
[2:24:13] <jamiei543> u gonna need hostage for it in future
[2:24:13] <NinjaTexan> @Vader it was because of your hostage voice
[2:24:14] <cheddybits> Have chang in an armored truck to bulldoze em!!!!!!
[2:24:15] <Tc0816> best way is a heli ^^
[2:24:16] <asquishypotato> rpg EZ
[2:24:16] <WaterproofMan> @Vader 1 on the rood?
[2:24:17] <G_Masta> check your time
[2:24:17] <DBCloggy> wait in the bushes on the other side of the road
[2:24:18] <pearjuice> @corywillis21 chang was broken out, and not correctly
[2:24:22] <Grimmjaws> üñï
[2:24:27] <WEEmanLITTLE> You could sit on that bridge
[2:24:32] <spareribs> Next time you could have someone wait outside the bank with a truck, and then run the cops over
[2:24:32] <mattrogers420> Chang got out cuse he was gonna get raided
[2:24:37] <ChadTheLad12> all because of a scuffed car @Vader
[2:24:38] <RustyJuice7> long did you get? @Vader
[2:24:39] <Withdra> The range is stupid on those guns
[2:24:41] <randy_randy_> There were 4 cops, 1 behind each car, one behind guard rail, one on bridge (left flank)
[2:24:41] <cheddybits> THat would be perfect for the armored truck change was joy riding the other night
[2:24:41] <Gatzarlok> Across the highway has that metal barrier that would be great LoS and cover
[2:24:43] <almighty_jens> hi cunt
[2:24:43] <stachenson> @vader true cuz i was watching cops and you guessed it right
[2:24:44] <Zurrqq> Its too bad the car fucked you by not letting you in
[2:24:47] <VerityNS> @Vader How many cops can they use at a Active situation?
[2:24:48] <Nocnybober> Yeah, the bridge would be a great idea
[2:24:51] <MrWholesomeLad> anyone got a clip of the shoot out please?
[2:24:53] <M4tjesf1let> all because of buddha :)
[2:24:56] <corywillis21> Sal said you did a good Stewie Griffin
[2:24:57] <Hawkeye_510> They also had the heliCOPter
[2:24:57] <AoJSpiderman> They had a heli too
[2:25:00] <trichag> its not worth it LUL
[2:25:00] <BallisticMunky> yeah, no matter what u get charged for attempted murder, so might as well try to injure them
[2:25:03] <Firewindwgames> It would be funny if someone sniped from the hill

[2:28:26] <trackstar221> @zurrqq guard
[2:28:26] <Teojor> drenching the bank in gasoline and having a hostage forces the cops to not shoot you while you escape

[2:38:39] <philmaddick> Cops were worried they permaed Dab
[2:38:41] <BrittneyLanpher> Dab is usually pretty easy going when it comes to the police catching him. So I think they tend to go easy on him generally.

[2:50:23] <tsm_darkgaming247> hey
[2:50:24] <justsomefuns> its mandatory chat is trolling you @Vader
[2:50:25] <NathanWhiteyy> Timmac was checking Yesterday to make sure everyone was on emote only for kimchi
[2:50:25] <Smunchnu> @HereticMoon That ^
[2:50:27] <sherminator011> who won yesturday?
[2:50:27] <oldDangson> its also implied that the streamer doesnt META and he is watching for it.
[2:50:28] <billiebobbo> its not optional
[2:50:30] <horrorvacu> Some guy was towing cars when the race was starting yesterday
[2:50:30] <TheXeloras> I feel like it depends on how much you trust chat not to meta
[2:50:31] <SimonSez> I watched Sun Moon say it was optional last night
[2:50:33] <WEEmanLITTLE> Show up, join someone without a partner?
[2:50:34] <WuTangSwede> @vader You could follow the most outrageous character around with your journalist character
[2:50:34] <Its_Chris91> @Vader moon watches everyones stream that is in the race to make sure they have emote only on
[2:50:34] <ally101972> I heard it straight from kimchi unless he changed it
[2:50:36] <the_nightman8> i think every in the last event will do it as a curtousy
[2:50:37] <KanyonWilson> Golden ticket is entrance to the final leg of the race
[2:50:38] <imtheflood> tuong for race

[2:58:55] <KentKLS> @durabai no it affect your ba Keepo
[2:58:55] <ChrisDKN> Imagine having to open an extra program
[2:58:55] <JohnnyRail> @Darkblood935 if that were the case there would be no need for a launcher to launch their own game. you just launch the game

[4:21:37] <WaterproofMan> But what person does gfuel now sponsor? THEY FUCKING SPONSOR EVERYONE
[4:21:37] <abdullah1277> Kill bredna
[4:21:37] <Trenzix> he said no and left

[4:21:40] <LPFreak64> Jellied Eels Flavor? @Vader
[4:21:40] <stealthymango1> who would want prune flavor G-fuel
[4:21:41] <chandlerboigaming> Do you make ur voice sound like that
[4:21:41] <Hawkeye_510> @Vader I agree. I got Mt Dew Ice, and it had Sucralose and sugar, but no mention of it being low cal or diet.
[4:21:42] <Sylkis> how much did they offer?
[4:21:43] <Triantalex> he said no BibleThump
[4:21:43] <Jayy_Dubs> @Vader You said you'll be sponsored by them if you were able to say you didnt like them LUL
[4:21:44] <Logan_Grim> Gfuel is trash, Real Preworkout stuff like oldschool Jack3d is the only good stuff
[4:21:44] <ey_brows> the sports guys just put the drink they prefer in the container of the sponsor and get paid
[4:21:45] <salmondrink> california has a soda sugar tax aswell
[4:21:46] <Pusherman555> @huh_pickle so does lettuce
[4:21:46] <Akers_X> @Vader Buy the Mexican version of the drinks, they use sugar cane
[4:21:47] <BrianDonnahue> probably was a shitty offer anyway atpWind

[4:38:29] <SmythSZN> Going into a coma would be a good character idea I suppose
[4:38:30] <mikezout14> I mean to be honest cops car drive pretty good, we have to deal with locals with lights it‚Äôs not as easy as people think
[4:38:30] <Sierra_____> They should use it a little at least ATV's are coo

[4:38:38] <Mr_Jhin4> @Vader "Young Dab moves to Vice City " :)
[4:38:38] <Zethice> I feel like he said he would never play just to make people not bother him about it doe
[4:38:42] <ImTheSleuth> @Vader Are the handling mechanics the same as normal GTA ?
[4:38:46] <Bodgerton> if you cant get away from cops in an infernus, go play Red Dead
[4:38:51] <skurplat> @yourfavoritekoala you realize that‚Äôs what he did before hand correct?

[10:07:13] <HughJardon> just when you said it wasn't a problem for you :(
[10:07:15] <CrunchRock> im gonna beat this servers ass
[10:07:16] <MacabreOS> and lie 20 chains
[10:07:17] <justsomefuns> he probably has a sql bug
[10:07:17] <Kickingsite> gomer lost nos
[10:07:18] <sereey> Prob from the disconnect at pillbox
[10:07:21] <Kekolt> it took 5 vg from dab
[10:07:24] <anextremeemo> it was probably like that there used to be that amount in that exact slot or something nuts like that
[10:07:26] <MacabreOS> *like
[10:07:28] <ucanthurtmehaha> makes enough to not care
[10:07:29] <Rafalss> @Vader Dab did tell you about disappearing stuff earlier today
[10:07:34] <anextremeemo> I dont even know what I just said
[10:07:35] <skuffed39> SO THE ENGLISH CANT CALL A CIG THE ENGLISH WORD FOR A SMOKE
[10:07:47] <jarrebear0615> dab only had a few VG's though
[10:07:49] <Rafalss> true
[10:07:50] <xcentrickone> sabb lost 200 chains todays
[10:07:56] <gramz> @Vader i think 78 is what one of the stacks was beore you combined them all
[10:08:00] <hunter_pls> that's incredibly annoying
[10:08:02] <TheXeloras> It's such a peculiar number to dissapear
[10:08:02] <CrunchRock> english people dont legit call cigarettes the f word usually
[10:08:06] <stevelfc977> ARMOUR
[10:08:09] <KidIcarusX> ask gommer if he is stacking them
[10:08:11] <skuffed39> caps dam
[10:08:12] <Valstraz19> @vader can gomer fix the breaks with the tuner?
[10:08:12] <Smunchnu> skuffed39 Not when Twitch's ToS say not to, i don't thing anyone is discussing it really
[10:08:13] <Je_ek> I think those 78 were there before you combined them
[10:08:13] <stevelfc977> yeeee
[10:08:18] <Mezoteus> Vader that head armor combo is fantastic
[10:08:18] <Popahya> He has armor WeirdChamp
[10:08:22] <xcentrickone> 1 stack
[10:08:22] <anextremeemo> I think he meant the bike
[10:08:22] <stevelfc977> never meant caps either btw
[10:08:23] <justsomefuns> @skuffed39 yes they can... It's about context
[10:08:23] <IIWhiteKnightII> Dab also lost 6 advanced lockpicks @Vader
[10:08:24] <quick___> they sent an OOC yesterday about fixing inventory stuff to fix duping prob unrelated tho
[10:08:25] <JoeBro> @Vader your 30 off chains turned into 1 though?
[10:08:25] <hunter_pls> oh well peepoHappy
[10:08:27] <gnome_nz> hit gomer up for a tuning chip
[10:08:28] <micalang> @CrunchRock older english people do
[10:08:31] <Nicksterkool> just got here wyd?
[10:08:35] <skuffed39> @smunchnu ..Gotcha
[10:08:35] <Kappa_PUG> have you had a chancce to use the AK?
[10:08:37] <DrMaple> @Vader Koil yesterday thinks the issue could be moving an item to a spot that was previously occupied without closing/opening the inventory again.
[10:08:42] <darrandarran74> What happened to frank
[10:08:46] <Mekio77> He lost 4 Thermite too
[10:08:56] <bloodybathtub> Thatd be a weird bug
[10:08:57] <CaneBeard> koil was trying to fix the duping bug
[10:09:00] <gramz> @Vader koil said he redid some of the inventory to fix a dupe
[10:09:01] <CrunchRock> @micalang yeah but i mean old people are still racist and type with two fingers
[10:09:02] <secretscoob> im digging the weather ahd the e
[10:09:05] <JohnnyRail> any debug info in console?
[10:09:09] <TheRealJasonX> @Vader just passed a Doube T
[10:09:12] <secretscoob> lighting
[10:09:14] <Tweker> yeah he changed the inventory doing to reduce duping
[10:09:14] <Popahya> Spaghetti code peepoHappy
[10:09:16] <Fapmoon> Koil was getting a lot of duping issues before he looked into the inventory coding though
[10:09:16] <Domry> can you put in a ticket like WOW and Koil will give it back?
