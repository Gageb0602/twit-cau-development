[0:17:39] <commi_pickle> im mr3
[0:17:44] <dia_arazkus> I'd have to reinstall warfarm to make you a build
[0:17:51] <commi_pickle> no need
[0:18:02] <commi_pickle> i can manage around the youtube guides
[0:18:04] <dia_arazkus> what you wanna do with him
[0:18:07] <dia_arazkus> DPS or tank
[0:18:10] <JackRubino> vaporaTip
[0:18:13] <commi_pickle> tank

[0:18:49] <dia_arazkus> Meg
[0:19:03] <commi_pickle> is that a meme
[0:19:04] <homxro> it‚Äôs high fantasy and spoiler: everyone dies
[0:19:07] <dia_arazkus> ye
[0:19:11] <commi_pickle> cool
[0:19:15] <homxro> it‚Äôs roughly based off a video game
[0:19:22] <homxro> (the magic is, not the plot)
[0:19:50] <commi_pickle> im making new weapons to max out for my mr
[0:19:52] <dia_arazkus> Blind rage and transient fortitue are needed for tank rhino
[0:20:10] <dia_arazkus> then steel fiber

[0:20:25] <commi_pickle> steel fiber is armour right?
[0:20:29] <homxro> what would you make the weapon?
[0:20:35] <dia_arazkus> Umbral fiber and umbral vitality after the sacrifice quest
[0:20:36] <dia_arazkus> yes

[0:23:13] <dia_arazkus> back when star chart 1.0 was a thing
[0:23:32] <commi_pickle> also why is my weapon mod capacity equal to my mr

[0:23:42] <dia_arazkus> it starts that way uintil you max the wep
[0:23:50] <dia_arazkus> like mine would be 25/50
[0:23:55] <commi_pickle> i know you can double it
[0:23:58] <commi_pickle> catalyst or something

[0:32:53] <Yochie> don't need any more "new meta" people in my games
[0:32:55] <homxro> like in my story god can create things obviously bc he‚Äôs god but he‚Äôs not omnipotent
[0:32:57] <Doineann3007> ...I'm not even joking

[3:14:38] <itstotallytilves> hi zialeska
[3:14:58] <Zialeska> I just played...a game of league and our Zoe was like 0/6 and was saying it was the junglers fault and it BLOWS MY MIND lol
[3:15:04] <itstotallytilves> or believing vaccine cause autism
[3:15:18] <Zialeska> just because the jungler DC... it was the junglers fault she fed her lane XD
[3:15:19] <Nightbot> Follow Vapora on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/vvaporadark/
[3:15:26] <Zialeska> why are league players like this
[3:15:35] <itstotallytilves> because it can't be there fault
[3:15:53] <Zialeska> and she ate every morg q and died to that too, junglers fault tho
[3:16:00] <Zialeska> I feel so bad for junglers man...
[3:16:03] <Zialeska> fuck that role
[3:16:08] <itstotallytilves> like yeh, I was in my de 2 class, which I loved, but I missed my meds one day and couldn't pay attention
[3:16:43] <itstotallyamber> !commands add !howtoimprove Generally speaking the best ways to improve on champs, lanes and the game overall in any elo are to read guides, watch videos/streams and keep practising. There's no magical solution or quick fix. Just invest as much time and knowledge as you can.
[3:16:44] <Nightbot> @itstotallyamber -> The command "!howtoimprove" has been added successfully.
[3:16:49] <Zialeska> I need adderal but it gives me seizures... so a lot of the time I give it to my friends... because Im that person
[3:16:50] <itstotallyamber> Thought this might be helpful :)
[3:16:58] <stinkyfooot> never heard of this meds thing
[3:17:08] <itstotallytilves> have you looked at vyvanse?
[3:17:32] <itstotallyamber> You can get medication to suppress the symptoms of ADHD. My niece takes meds.
[3:18:01] <itstotallytilves> also vyvanse is great because it's basically impossibly to od on it
[3:18:36] <itstotallytilves> @stinkyfooot ADHD or adderall?
[3:19:09] <Doineann3007> LUL
[3:19:57] <itstotallytilves> I'm on vyvanse
[3:20:14] <Zialeska> o_O my doctor only gave me one other option but they said that the kind of medicine it is was causing the issue and its scary enough that I gave up trying new meds

[3:20:20] <Zialeska> same with anti depressants tbh
[3:20:25] <itstotallytilves> oof
[3:20:38] <itstotallytilves> I hope I'll getting antidepressants soon
[3:20:42] <itstotallyamber> Maybe a stupid thought but is enemy mid/jgl funnel comp?
[3:20:48] <itstotallyamber> Or just normal lanes.
[3:20:53] <Zialeska> i got seratonin syndrome once from an anti depressant that I liked and the seizure I got from that was horrifying and I dont even have a seizure issue

[3:21:51] <itstotallyamber> I learned.
[3:21:51] <Doineann3007> meh, I never took any meds for my issues, or sought help, been a rough ride but holding on...I'm way too stubborn LUL

[3:22:20] <itstotallytilves> I'd end up dead if I didn't seek help for my issues at this point tbh
[3:22:38] <itstotallyamber> Meds can defo help take the edge off but really you need someone to talk to, be a therapist or friend or w/e.
[3:23:12] <itstotallytilves> I had to get an online therapist because I couldn't get a therapist that specializes in my issues lol
[3:23:13] <itstotallyamber> You should never suffer in silence. It hurts more than it helps.
[3:23:16] <Doineann3007> aye, guess I'm used to keeping things to myself so not affected as much
[3:23:27] <Zialeska> I mean...Ive tried to end my life, Ive been on every anti depressant in the book, I think at this point I would rather die by my own hand than by seizures or another rare side effect of meds
[3:23:44] <Doineann3007> just when I open up, the people I open up to kinda give up on me LUL
[3:23:50] <itstotallytilves> awww zialeska that bit good. I'd be so sad if you died

[3:35:14] <itstotallyamber> No judging.
[3:35:14] <Zialeska> I love the SG but elderwood is more my aesthetic

[3:40:36] <itstotallyamber> The only thing you're allowed to beat is your meat.
[3:40:49] <itstotallytilves> I mean skins are decided based on play rate and the easy of making skins
[3:40:59] <Zialeska> god my win ratio is now at 44% because of yesterday
[3:41:08] <Zialeska> Im afraid to even try and fix it
[3:41:15] <Zialeska> this patch has not been good to me
[3:41:17] <itstotallytilves> like people complain about certain champs not getting skins and it's because no one plays them
[3:41:26] <Zialeska> yeah
[3:41:33] <Doineann3007> aye
[3:41:48] <Shawfall> ur bad
[3:41:49] <Zialeska> and I find the people who complain the most are people who generally dont even play the champ...like those of us that do are excited
[3:41:56] <itstotallytilves> people just love to complain
[3:42:05] <Zialeska> the people I saw complain the most about yuumi were people that didnt even play support
[3:42:11] <itstotallytilves> @shawfall I know I'm bad, that's why I'm still alive
[3:42:11] <Zialeska> yep
