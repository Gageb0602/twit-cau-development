[0:09:22] <Nightbot> Generally speaking the best ways to improve on champs, lanes and the game overall in any elo are to read guides, watch videos/streams and keep practising. There's no magical solution or quick fix. Just invest as much time and knowledge as you can.

[0:27:30] <Doineann3007> it'll be good to see a video version of the ADC guides
[0:27:32] <homxro> if there‚Äôs gonna be no limit to your videos, does that mean you‚Äôd upload videos made by someone else?
[0:27:45] <homxro> say a script is given and the clips, all you need to do is the voice over
[0:28:51] <itstotallyamber> I expect he'd like to do it all himself, though maybe he'd get clips from other people's plays as examples.

[0:37:58] <itstotallyamber> Homer plz accept that he's not doing it rn. Maybe down the line, in which case he'll ask you.

[4:30:29] <dimitrisere> gg @VaporaDark carry us to victory
[4:30:36] <homxro> most people don‚Äôt tend to stay friends after a relationship
[4:30:39] <itstotallyamber> Bro you almost lost her once. If you become too close as friends you may never get another shot.
[4:30:43] <homxro> even if handled like adults
[4:31:04] <homxro> i rather a life long friendship with her than lose her if things go south
[4:31:18] <homxro> there‚Äôs only 2 choices, either we break up or i marry her
[4:31:36] <Captain_Roostic> that logic there homer is White Knight Logic microSip
[4:31:36] <homxro> or she murder me because she‚Äôs a lil psycho but in a good way

[4:33:07] <homxro> my ex was shading me while we were ‚Äúbroken up‚Äù and when we tried again she leaves me and is now talking to someone else
[4:33:13] <homxro> i thought i would marry this girl

[4:35:41] <itstotallytilves> even still

[5:11:49] <vKae> how much they pay for your soul?
[5:12:10] <homxro> sounds goofy enough to work with a serious plot
[5:12:13] <Curcolio> @homxro a movie would have been much too short
[5:12:14] <homxro> it‚Äôs perfect imo
[5:12:25] <itstotallytilves> if we are talking about sexy guys, Jason momoa
[5:12:26] <itstotallyamber> I think it kinda puts across the idea that the bad balances the good.
[5:12:28] <itstotallytilves> aquaman
[5:12:30] <Curcolio> well the plot is that they lost the antichrist when he was a baby

[5:13:01] <itstotallyamber> Wonder how far it goes into like morality and stuff.
[5:13:07] <MrC4rnage> @Curcolio sounds like plot from Lucius games
[5:13:09] <lesterfol> Demon and an angel has to find the antichrist cos little shit ran away and two dipshits lost him on earth.
