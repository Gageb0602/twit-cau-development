[0:20:24] <jaxontee> True
[0:20:24] <Metaellihead> @KingRichard if you read between the lines of this contract thing, Banks says we only collected x dollars, doesn't mean they couldn't enforce the contract later and take his hard earned cash. Twitch pays to the player directly, if you have a contract with an org to split that you have to pay them.
[0:20:25] <rosecityy> The sad thing is Banks owns part of faze but he doesn‚Äôt have control over that side of the business. That‚Äôs the corporate side he doesn‚Äôt get to see

[0:24:11] <StealthFatal> I dont get why the contract is the talking point. Every organization in the world signs people to initial shit contracts. Not only gaming but this happens in sports.

[0:24:51] <phillyc55> @kingrichard it should be public but like i said a contract is still a contract example kid comes out of high school signs with the phillies 2 years later the kid is mike trout getting penauts and then he redoes his contract
[0:24:54] <FireFace888> cheer100 can u call me a TittyTaint?
[0:24:56] <kodak_black15> tfue is a goat

[0:25:00] <StealthFatal> @ChrisppApples But initial contracts in all sports usually the first one isnt geared towards the signee.

[0:25:00] <drc229> Chat young minds are variable that's the shit yall dont they are easy influenced into signing for whatever among of money when you dont know what your future holds
[0:25:03] <kembawalker155> i thought Banks made a good video but i dont know who to believe

[0:25:07] <OOFSPOOK> Thing is,if Faze never collected, even if it says they take 80%. They are entitled to take it, this lawsuit is no good, he should've left it. Tfue might have to pay up.
[0:25:08] <ChrisppApples> EXACTLY you on twitch with 7 viewers FAZE Like yo sign this contract to join the org.... "SIGNED"
[0:25:09] <trickworms> so pro gamers are underpaid?

[0:26:35] <ItsSIay> FaZe Clan never took anything. Just because he is scared of losing all his money, than he could speak to them all offline. It wasn‚Äôt necessary to make it public. They had not done anything yet
[0:26:41] <Glidergirrl> Banks tattoo 80% off code Tfue
[0:26:43] <ChrisppApples> @TOPGUNNER123 your ignorant. thats not how opportunities work. especially when you broke.

[0:29:45] <notmaccas> @chrisppapples didn‚Äôt say it was a problem if you read it correctly I said I don‚Äôt blame him? But they could of worked around it- even spoke about no commission from subs/YouTube/ads/tournaments - they weren‚Äôt taking any money as it was so if Faze is saying the wouldn‚Äôt take anything I‚Äôm sure they could of changed it all....
[0:29:47] <xBinary001x> 1 m views is 10k usd

[0:29:58] <rosecityy> Tfue is making millions a month from YouTube, twitch, ad revenue etc. 5 million a month sounds about right
[0:29:59] <FireFace888> who is this kid?
[0:30:01] <dualdavids> Don‚Äôt be proud of stupid kids who are entitled and thinks they can just do whatever.... this is life folks.... graphs show when he signed he blew up

[0:30:23] <Staxbee> Alissa Violet is a EZ clap üç∞ üçë üí¶
[0:30:41] <StealthFatal> That contract was made not expecting Tfue to be what he is now.

[0:30:44] <HeavyJTIII> Even what YT pays him isn't enough
[0:30:46] <Kensaya> I mean if true accepted then he is db bro

[0:30:49] <xBinary001x> its on google
[0:30:49] <Izaslayer> that is all
[0:30:53] <savage_dre34> @chrisppapples stream?
[0:30:54] <Kensaya> Dumb
[0:30:57] <smokinj0e> 1 mill a year is probably less than 20 percent

[0:31:23] <rosecityy> The contract was made to get money off of Tfue regardless if he became big or not. It‚Äôs just unfortunate he blew up
[0:31:26] <Kensaya> If you sign a contract and do not think about what that means... is on you
[0:31:26] <ichiefsi> clockz lmao
[0:31:30] <broken8922> Didn‚Äôt think this would go to court but looks like it may now
[0:31:39] <Sawler14> Regardless all they do is video game do you really need that much money? Bruh I can barely afford my car payment
[0:31:41] <iDark_Swish> i just woke up from surgery thanks for the support @KingRichard
[0:31:50] <CallMeRaxyy> shes talking like its a scrim
[0:31:56] <ChrisppApples> @notmaccas don't let them fool you. 1 company will pay FAZE 1 million per month easy if they can activate Tfue. How many companies will do this? People have value and they deserve that especially if someone is making that money off of you. Can i make 1 million off of you and give you nothing? or not tell you about it?
[0:31:57] <xBinary001x> why are you here @Sawler14
[0:32:02] <Izaslayer> He's
[0:32:03] <notmaccas> @kensaya COULDNT AGREE MORE DUDE! You sign a fucking contract that‚Äôs definitely on you üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[0:33:14] <iDark_Swish> it went good almost poked an artery tho but were all good
[0:33:15] <unknownmirage> @kingrichard while people should be paid their worth his taking this public was a snakes approach. Regardless,he kbowlingly signed that contract and did het exposure with their help. a contract is a contract and renegotiation is friendly at the least.
[0:33:19] <xBinary001x> who is RL player
[0:33:21] <CJ3151> Banks releases the contract and we see whose wrong its that simple
[0:33:22] <broken8922> Damn man. Hope you‚Äôre doing okay
[0:33:30] <Sawler14> @xbinary001x why did you @ me like it was a joke
[0:33:32] <iDark_Swish> !add
[0:33:36] <ChrisppApples> For once in your lives. Put yourselves in someone else's shoes. Your a kid and you really want to join a org. They give you a contract. Most likely even if you don't like and you tell them. They might say take it or leave it. Most people are going to take it.
[0:33:37] <juicedonion> Faze's rep is gonna take huge hit after this
[0:33:41] <dualdavids> @unknownmirage Facts
[0:33:41] <Kensaya> @unknownmirage Yes exactly
[0:33:46] <xBinary001x> he tried for a full year to negotiate a better contract quietly lmfao yall super salty

[0:33:53] <CashRunzDaWorld> tsue
[0:33:56] <chuckyd140> @KingRichard hope ur contract is better than tfue's <3

[0:34:15] <kyleliu2013> Who s the guy he s playing with
[0:34:18] <notmaccas> @chrisppapples iv been watching Tfue since the H1Z1 days, Faze did help him in some points get him to where he is- but at the same time- Faze ‚Äúapparently‚Äù haven‚Äôt taken anymore from him as of yet, so I don‚Äôt blame Tfue for wanting to change the contract but the way he‚Äôs gone about it is stupid, also, he should of looked at the contract a little more and not just signed away ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è guess he didn‚Äôt realise he would get as big as he has but that‚Äôs his fault.
[0:34:22] <xBinary001x> guys if you sign a contract take it a lawyer and court if you want to get out of it
[0:34:22] <TRACKSTAR_27> Yooo
[0:34:23] <madshottas> @unknownmirage that wasn‚Äôt a snakes approach at all if he had went at them face first they would‚Äôve more than likely tried to force him into staying and shit wouldn‚Äôt probably got violent knowing banks
[0:34:25] <iDark_Swish> could we maybe play sometime when i get out of the hospital maybe @KingRichard

[0:36:44] <Metaellihead> Would balls be more balanced if they took damage from the environment?
[0:36:44] <ichiefsi> You guys can talk about Tfue and Banks all you want but keep it civilized
[0:36:49] <iDark_Swish> could we maybe play sometime when i get out of the hospital maybe @KingRichard
[0:36:50] <JSourD> Release the contract
[0:36:53] <ChrisppApples> @Izaslayer ABSOLUTELY. people can't see paste themselves. you have to detach and step back. Saying shit like, "Well he should have read it" is so ignorant. It's more to contracts than that. Your cell phone contract is BS but everyone signs them. It's all you have lol. You can fight to make it better but thats beyond people. They are used to being owned.
[0:36:54] <kodak_black15> what was banks tweet?
[0:36:58] <Flames_AZ> this contract must be so fucking terrible monkaW
[0:37:00] <coreywalton_> Grab that wood? KappaPride
[0:37:00] <Reacktz> @juicedonion nah 100% not true
[0:37:03] <backwoodwallin> @lcceyy hate to break it to you that‚Äôs what he wanted Jebaited
[0:37:05] <madshottas> Idk how people don‚Äôt realize when you‚Äôre that valuable certain shit you have to take public because if you keep it private then your life is more or less on the line. Ignorance everyewhere
[0:37:11] <lcceyy> Tsue
[0:37:12] <CJ3151> @kodak_black15 he basically said the contract is coming asap
[0:37:21] <jadengocrzyfn> Bank said there gonna release the contract
[0:37:23] <kodak_black15> good
[0:37:27] <kyleliu2013> Is he streaming now
[0:37:27] <kodak_black15> thanks @CJ3151
[0:37:33] <notmaccas> @chrisppapples and it‚Äôs not like Tfue hasn‚Äôt been under a contract before this- he knows about contracts he had a contract signed with an esports .org when playing h1z1 the guy fucked up and is speaking about it now, his fault that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying got nothing against anything to do with Tfue or Faze watch them all, but it could of alllll been handled so much better.
[0:37:34] <imxzotiic> Guys quit talking about tfue all he need to do is get his money back Kappa
[0:37:37] <iDark_Swish> could we maybe play sometime when i get out of the hospital maybe @KingRichard

[0:38:18] <imxzotiic> @unknownmirage LUL
[0:38:24] <kodak_black15> tfue looked pretty upset in his vid so there's gotta be a reason why
[0:38:25] <Kensaya> I choose to pay. If I did not like I would read the agreement of others to get a better deal
[0:38:28] <Reacktz> @juicedonion but hes still on the faze team on twitch meaning they have access to all of his statistics and shit, as well as tweeting specifically saying hes NOT leaving faze
[0:38:31] <jadengocrzyfn> He tweeted agin
[0:38:36] <backwoodwallin> @unknownmirage uhhhh........exactly????
[0:38:41] <unknownmirage> not even going to #@ your comment ;)

[0:40:10] <ChrisppApples> @notmaccas I'm not taking sides just trying to listen from both. he knows his worth and needs a better contract one that is closer to his value, that's not happening so now he is taking legal action. People are looking at this like Faze vs Tfue, its a big issue. you can't take advantage of peoples ignorance. you have no idea how much money they back just by having the Tfue name. there is money that you don't see on the table.
[0:40:11] <Reacktz> joog squad and banks are going at it right now jratePOP

[0:40:16] <Izaslayer> @chrisppapples Precisely! great comparison as well with the phone contract. similar to getting a car note you do what you have to do. People are just USED to others thinking for them and it shows in their actions and reactions smh. Unfortunately they'll learn the hard way or wake tf up

[0:40:47] <ThePizzaMan02858> courageDAD
[0:40:48] <CJ3151> @jadengocrzyfn i feel like banks is hiding something huge
[0:40:49] <admittedbrake219> @asap_clapped hopefully
[0:40:52] <Roberto9420> No Tfue and fazZZZzE shiiiiit
[0:40:56] <ichiefsi> Don't worry about clipping it guys, if it's anything like last night he'll be hitting them all dayyyyyy

[0:40:57] <hamzsins> LA CHONA!!!!!!!
[0:40:57] <Flames_AZ> imagine if tfue and banks were already in agreement to script this whole thing as a last request before tfue leaves faze hamzHMM
[0:40:58] <StealthFatal> @brandon203276 how was that a mess up?
[0:41:02] <death___reaper> death___reaper subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[0:41:04] <bonew> who is this kid?
[0:41:09] <notmaccas> I understand why the contract would be the way it was, Tfue wasn‚Äôt making anything near what he‚Äôs making now, and now that he is making bank he‚Äôs freaking out so he wants to get out, but at the time he didn‚Äôt give a fuck, again no one else to blame but himself and he should of been so fucking stupid ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è
[0:41:13] <juicedonion> Banks last tweet makes him look really bad, its like his keeping him hostage
[0:41:14] <Roberto9420> Yeeees banks its pusssssssy af
[0:41:29] <hamzsins> NAAA
[0:41:33] <hamzsins> HE AINT
[0:41:35] <jadengocrzyfn> @cj3151 Yea he said he was gonna release now he wants to talk about it in person so that contract won‚Äôt get exposed
[0:41:36] <Roberto9420> Omg king
[0:41:37] <Controllered> @roberto9420 have a little respect fam.

[0:41:40] <Metaellihead> KR is nuts
[0:41:44] <Flames_AZ> @notmaccas yeah sure but theres no way u should be giving someone as bad of a contract as tfue claims he's got regardless
[0:41:50] <Glidergirrl> Release him from the contract
[0:41:51] <t3hburm> @notmaccas agreed. sign better contracts
[0:41:54] <TooTrillBih> who is KR playing with?
[0:41:55] <Bohners> tfues video has 14% dislikes :/
[0:41:56] <hamzsins> my nutz are nut
[0:41:57] <Flames_AZ> of how much money he's making
[0:42:05] <CJ3151> @jadengocrzyfn something is definently going on he doesnt want the public to know, just release turner from faze
[0:42:06] <NaniMann> Why in the world would the hang time outfit have jordan cloths and nike shoes??? TF man put some Js ON!
[0:42:06] <se1lout> if tfue really wanted to stay in faze, he could sign a new contract. imo
[0:42:18] <TBExNeto> Fact of the matter is Tfue wants to break his contract with FaZe and has no interest in renegotiating a more beneficial deal for the same term.. GREED
[0:42:25] <StealthFatal> @jadengocrzyfn buddy its not about the contract getting exposed. he considers Tfue family and wants to talk to him and not lawyers
[0:42:26] <notmaccas> I wouldn‚Äôt say that, I think banks is handling shit well, if he really wanted to legally he could take what Faze is legally allowed to take but hasn‚Äôt gone down that line yet. So I think it‚Äôs kinda funny tbh
[0:42:30] <Flames_AZ> i mean u gotta hold orgs responsible if theyre taking advantage of young people who cant afford to get a lawyer or make a good decision
[0:42:31] <Kensaya> It‚Äôs whatever. Streamer kid wants more of his money. In other news a firefighter saved 3 babies and a mom
[0:42:34] <Flames_AZ> hamzHMM
[0:42:44] <CJ3151> its dumb cause turner tried getting out of his contract for the last 6-7 months
[0:42:46] <hamzsins> Tsm_Tfue LOL
[0:42:55] <Izaslayer> @nanimann LMAOO THEY JORDAN 1S BRUV
[0:42:55] <OneThirty> @nanimann The skin is wearing the bred 1s. They are Jordan shoes

[0:43:15] <jadengocrzyfn> @stealthfatal Yea I see that but saying that right after he said he‚Äôs gonna release the contract is fishy but if he just wants to meet as friends I get that too
[0:43:27] <UUGG> Banks says theyare releasing him from contract.

[0:43:42] <Izaslayer> 1s the best js next to 3s and 4s
[0:43:43] <CJ3151> just show the whole contract and let turner go
[0:43:45] <Kensaya> Yo I don‚Äôt even care about this contract talk anymore. Seems like it will get resolved
[0:43:45] <notmaccas> @flames_az yeah but you have to think at the time Tfue wasn‚Äôt making that much money at all, sure it might of been a steep contract but at the same time, Faze is trying to make profit also again it‚Äôs no one else‚Äôs fault but Tfue and if he didn‚Äôt sign the contact he wouldn‚Äôt be in this shit situation
[0:43:54] <UUGG> now they just have to release Cloak now
[0:43:54] <juicedonion> Banks constantly tweeting makes him look more guilty
[0:43:55] <TooTrillBih> @paradox_terrxnort you do
[0:43:59] <SarEEnox> R3L3ASE C0NTRACT
[0:44:00] <paradox_terrxnort> @TooTrillBih I do very thicccy uhh
[0:44:06] <kinglkerrigan> #releasethefukencontract
[0:44:09] <hzdmistakes> üêê
[0:44:15] <avasack> If it‚Äôs true that banks gave him multiple options to amend the contract to the point of absolutely no chance of turners money being taken in the future then I think at this point turner just wants the contracts of future signees to not be taken advantage of like his was. And he just wants nothing to do with FaZe anymore
[0:44:16] <CJ3151> @juicedonion facts
[0:44:17] <Kensaya> I am sure they will have some rights to tfue stuff
[0:44:17] <TooTrillBih> hahahaha @paradox_terrxnort
[0:44:18] <donnymyers561> release the contract
[0:44:20] <ChrisppApples> The released part of the contract.... LOOK AT IT PEOPLE.
[0:44:21] <Nightbot> Follow KR on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KingRichard
[0:44:23] <StealthFatal> I'm curious as to how this is going to effect Cloakzy if all.
[0:44:23] <jadengocrzyfn> Tfue and banks are dming as we speaküòÇ
[0:44:24] <TBExNeto> Banks just put Tfue's dad on blassst
[0:44:28] <Kensaya> Tfue will release from contract
[0:44:30] <xBinary001x> yall are wannabe gangstas and then turn into wannabe paper gangstas when you hear contracts...pathetic
[0:44:32] <Bohners> cloak is team,leader lol
[0:44:33] <wethoominfacts> Love it when he bought two Tesla's in a day. That says a lot.
[0:44:37] <Reacktz> banks is trying to blame tfues family for this whole thing...YIKES
[0:44:40] <ChrisppApples> @summit1g said ITS WHACK!!!
[0:44:52] <avasack> @stealthfatal Cloak took FaZe out of his fortnite name. Guessing he‚Äôll be leaving too
[0:45:00] <Bohners> corrina ninjaS
[0:45:01] <CJ3151> banks blaming everyone but himself yikes
[0:45:10] <Izaslayer> @wethoominfacts it was his birth. ... nvm :)
[0:45:14] <StealthFatal> @avasack oh snaps did he really? damnit man
[0:45:15] <Nightbot> Join our partnered discord server now! https://discordapp.com/invite/ZUcEc8e
[0:45:16] <jadengocrzyfn> @stealthfatal probably not gonna affect him or tfue going to the World Cup but cloak might try to get out of his contract as well or just stay who knows
[0:45:17] <ChrisppApples> @KingRichard They blamed it on a different legal team lol
[0:45:22] <kodak_black15> banks is pretty much saying tfue owes him to stay in their org because they brought him up
[0:45:26] <avasack> @reacktz I think banks was just saying that his family is chaotic and thinks they know everything about what was going on and convinced turner it was the right thing to do
[0:45:26] <another0nnne> Tfue is ok i hope cloak is to
[0:45:30] <CJ3151> @avasack if this whole thing with turner keeps going bad cloak is probably gone
[0:45:34] <wethoominfacts> Overall Tfue is sorta destroying his image imo from how he is handling this.
[0:45:36] <juicedonion> Classic damage control from banks LUL
[0:45:42] <ChrisppApples> Faze DID give him a shitty contract based on what Summit looked at
[0:45:47] <timmy6988420> #ReleaseTheContract
[0:45:51] <bader_shams> Can u give me some tips to improve my aim
[0:45:54] <iamjexlur> @kingrichard there releasing the contract in 5 min check banks twitter
[0:45:55] <jayshel21> so weak they threw out all that dirt on faze then he gonna act like that wasnt supposed to be released
[0:45:58] <kodak_black15> #releasethecontract
[0:46:01] <avasack> @stealthfatal he still has the FaZe logo on his cam and stuff but yeah took out the FaZe in his name. Interesting! But who knows if he can get out of his contract either
[0:46:01] <ChrisppApples> They took 80% of his deals....
[0:46:03] <OneThirty> @wethoominfacts Tfue is handling it like a professional..... FailFish

[0:46:22] <jadengocrzyfn> @chrisppapples Not proven
[0:46:25] <avasack> @cj3151 I agree, they‚Äôre doing fine with or without the org anyway. FaZe needs them more at this point
[0:46:33] <juicedonion> @wethoominfacts He's been banned on twitch twice before and still one of the biggest streamers. He'll get more traction after this if anything
[0:46:36] <notmaccas> @slimhazy you sure about that? How many times has banks tried to contact him wanting to talk about this whole situation in person but won‚Äôt, at the end of the day, if Faze isn‚Äôt wanting to take any of Tfue‚Äôs money they will remove the contract, but at the same time, they‚Äôre also allowed to take the amount that‚Äôs legally owed to them, again no ones to blame for this shit BUT Tfue he has been in contracts before on other games he knows better ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è

[0:47:22] <StealthFatal> @ChrisppApples contract was definitely shitty. 80/20 split for Faze is absurd but Banks did mention that its in everyones old contract and they never collected on anyones. So IF thats true and they dont have any back payments waiting, then i dont think that is that bad
[0:47:26] <broken8922> They want to meet up and try to solve it?
[0:47:27] <hutupcuzyourbreathstanks> Banks better sandpaper code tfue off his leg now LUL
[0:47:35] <TMBigmanNZ> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:47:39] <kodak_black15> real shit tho if bank cares as much about tfue as he says "family" then he would let him do his thing if he wanted to leave faze
[0:47:41] <CJ3151> Watch them only release part of the contract @ChrisppApples
[0:47:43] <ChrisppApples> @jadengocrzyfn FAZE Release part of it and it says they are taking 80% of his DEALS
[0:47:47] <jayshel21> tfue really gonna destroy faze cuz he never read his contract

[0:47:59] <cynical12> @notmaccas how about let him out of the contract like he should if he was his friend

[0:49:09] <notmaccas> @chrisppapples can‚Äôt really said they‚Äôre ripping him off- they helped Tfue become who he is today- again use to watch Tfue the guy would max out 500 views if he was lucky maybe 1k if he got a host so he‚Äôs Faze has helped him- wasn‚Äôt for banks he wouldn‚Äôt of been in Friday Fortnite- wouldn‚Äôt of teamed with cloak, can‚Äôt really sit here and say that Tfue did it all on his own when he didn‚Äôt.
[0:49:10] <juicedonion> The 80% 20% split is mentioned because its an oppurtunity for orgs to rip off naive kids. It shouldnt even be a thing

[0:49:50] <ichiefsi> Honestly the only people that should care in this chat are @kingrichard and @chrisppapples lmao so many internet know-it-alls
[0:49:55] <iorcus> banks said that he want tfue to be loyal to him and that faze is the best thing for tfue LMAO!
[0:49:57] <juicedonion> Imagine justifying an 80 20 split
[0:50:13] <ChrisppApples> @TBExNeto thats Deflection is brand deals are 80% Faze 20%Tfue

[0:50:17] <TBExNeto> @ChrisppApples So Banks is lying??
[0:50:21] <Izaslayer> gg yall
[0:50:23] <nighthawk_md03> will u be in fortnite friday @kingrichard ?
[0:50:24] <avasack> It was blown out of proportion, I guess the contract said that FaZe has the right in the future to take 80% of the players earnings. Right? So now that turner is huge he is scared of having his money taken. Which is understandable but he did sign it........ and banks said they made countless attempts to amend it and take that part out but Tfue didn‚Äôt want anything but to be out of it completely

[0:50:53] <CJ3151> summit goes in depth of the 80 20 stuff wow
[0:51:01] <redstripped> That‚Äôs arena mode for you currently. They suicided to kill kr
[0:51:01] <Metaellihead> banks is on maximum damage control, he's getting permission from the "hier ups" to release the contract...dude isn't even in charge of anything, he's just a PR man
[0:51:06] <baka_47> some a boogie
[0:51:06] <alpha_loudi> CAN I GET THE LINK OF WHERE IT SAYS THEY TAKE 80%
[0:51:13] <southwardbubps4> PJSalt
[0:51:15] <Zazakita> wait do people believe that ftue would sign a contract that gave him only 20% percent? at the time he wasnt big but i believe he would have more respect for himself
[0:51:19] <bossross88> wow, as jacked up as it is. he still signed the contract
[0:51:20] <iorcus> @notmaccas we get it. so you saying he should stay at faze his entire career?
[0:51:23] <avasack> @metaellihead bruh he owns the company
[0:51:24] <ChrisppApples> @Metaellihead Doubt he needs permission...
[0:51:25] <primalzy0> Yeah fr
[0:51:26] <CJ3151> @alpha_loudi watch the video of summit going over the stuff
[0:51:35] <butoro25> what happened to apex brother
[0:51:38] <Jayphazes> @alpha_loudi its on faze clans twitter
[0:51:40] <TBExNeto> @ChrisppApples Either way renegotiate your contract terms and see out the remaining 2-3 years. The guys a millionaire
[0:51:43] <redstripped> They need hard reset each season and rewards and leveling back to keep people trying in arena. Too many not caring like those suiciders
[0:51:44] <rentan1> whats the name of this song
[0:51:46] <CJ3151> @alpha_loudi summit shows where it says 80% company 20% gamer
[0:51:52] <Classxifiedkl> tfue's brother and banks are going at it as well
[0:51:53] <nighthawk_md03> hopefully it does faze r some idiots
[0:51:57] <southwardbubps4> What skin does lil dude have on
[0:51:59] <DannyJB_> @butoro25 apex is dead brother
[0:52:02] <primalzy0> I think that faze held the fact that they can take a lot of his money over him
[0:52:04] <Zazakita> @rentan1 look back at it
[0:52:06] <VISH_PWND> i love sleeping in and watching KR <3
[0:52:12] <fpsdr0p> music way too loud
[0:52:12] <ChrisppApples> @TBExNeto Naw... people don't work like that when they want to be successful everyone takes bad deals.
[0:52:13] <Jayphazes> @cj3151 its in faze clans twitter
[0:52:18] <Metaellihead> @ChrisppApples he said he cleared it with "hier ups" on his twitter, maybe he started Faze but I don't think he's really running it...like really running it
[0:52:27] <sarcasmgaming_> tfue is full of shit no contract takes 80% and if they did why did tfue sign it LUL doesnt make sense people actually believe him
[0:52:34] <jasonbry> Goodluck to your tourneys @kingrichard
[0:52:39] <CJ3151> @Jayphazes watch summit show the statement it clearly says 80% organization
[0:52:41] <ChrisppApples> @Metaellihead Doubt it... he probably consulted a PR about how to release it.
[0:52:46] <squillyummmm> He literally said ‚Äúhirer ups‚Äù like bruh üíÄ
[0:52:47] <primalzy0> @sarcasmgaming_ you are an idiot
[0:52:49] <Izaslayer> Look at uzi yall... he not making no more music til he out of his deal. correction releasing

[0:52:57] <TBExNeto> @ChrisppApples You live and learn. That's the fun thing about being young
[0:52:57] <notmaccas> @iorcus he won‚Äôt be apart of Faze anymore after this I doubt it üòÇ and I hope not but the dudes been in other contracts before this when playing h1z1 who would be stupid enough to sign a 3 year contract that only gives you 20% AHAHAHA you have to be stupid nothing else but just a completely ducking idiot and I like the bloke but ducking hell he needed to think.
[0:52:58] <iorcus> @rentan1 look back at it by boogie with hoodie
[0:53:01] <Izaslayer> now tfue not streaming til he out of his deal seems like it
[0:53:02] <terrylufc1996> KR you playing in fortnite friday on 31st?
[0:53:05] <avasack> The drinking stuff was a little absurd, shows that turner needed a lot more ‚Äúillegal‚Äù points in order to get out of the contract....
[0:53:06] <CJ3151> @ChrisppApples link the summit video for everyone again
[0:53:08] <Metaellihead> @squillyummmm exactly, this man is in panic mode
[0:53:08] <sarcasmgaming_> @primalzy0 wanna bet?
[0:53:08] <itseford> Sarcasm gaming he did it so he would have exposure and when he was dumb or that‚Äôs what he wants us to think we don‚Äôt know who is right yet
[0:53:18] <Izaslayer> these industries ultimately look out for themselves and you'll learn that
[0:53:19] <CJ3151> @Izaslayer its smart on turners end
[0:53:19] <nick287777> Omg the kid from yesterday!!
[0:53:26] <avasack> Tfue gonna have like 200k+ viewers when he streams again. Y‚Äôall agree?
[0:53:35] <itseford> Yep
[0:53:37] <HungryPanda> in the contract they state that if they deem it to be right they can "collect" up to 80% of the members earnings
[0:53:37] <nick287777> Yup
[0:53:38] <blently27> yall toxic
[0:53:38] <UUGG> all this hurts FaZe in the end.. Banks should stop tweeting =X
[0:53:38] <CJ3151> @avasack easy 150K+
[0:53:45] <butoro25> drag dizzzy lol
[0:53:50] <ichiefsi> @avasack 500k+
[0:53:52] <StealthFatal> I just went to my manager and told him i have outperformed my initial contract. Lets just say i am going to the unemployment office first thing in the morning . Thanks Tfue Kappa
[0:53:52] <ChrisppApples> @TBExNeto Exactly but that isn't a pass to fuck KIDS over. One kid signed to pay an org 20% of his winnings after the qualifier and he wasn't on the org when he qualified
[0:53:58] <nighthawk_md03> hahah imma watch tfue wheen hes back
[0:54:00] <CJ3151> Banks is making it all worse by constantly tweeting

[0:54:20] <notmaccas> @avasack for sure but 99% will just be simply asking about the whole situation and I know for a fact he couldn‚Äôt be fucked answering all the questions he probs just want to move on with his life and stream Fortnite and not deal with this shit
[0:54:24] <balexp9000> @kCalamityPlays WHERE
[0:54:27] <CJ3151> turner gets an easy 200K+ views on the return stream easy

[0:54:35] <kCalamityPlays> @kingrichard can you react to tfues new YouTube vid
[0:54:45] <ChrisppApples> @CJ3151 Banks is trying to counter the bad press. other members will probably leave then there is no FAZE without players.
[0:54:45] <iorcus> @notmaccas he was a kid/ minor whrn he singed that contract. i wouldnt say he is an idiot.

[0:55:34] <broken8922> Can‚Äôt be renegotiated at this point.

[0:55:38] <CJ3151> @squillyummmm bet thats what happens
[0:55:38] <kCalamityPlays> Release*
[0:55:41] <opchase> that bullet grazed his cheeks LUL
[0:55:56] <nicknorman1> @cj3151 TFue is trying to destroy faze why wouldnt banks back it up?
[0:55:57] <TBExNeto> @ChrisppApples I'm not disagreeing.. I'm just saying he should at least rep the org that helped him come up and that's willing to give him a 7 figure salary contract with 0% deductions for the remainder of his term
[0:56:07] <ichiefsi> Definitely -0%
[0:56:18] <CJ3151> @ChrisppApples i mean after all this shit going down is anyone gonna wanna sign to faze anymore
[0:56:21] <avasack> Who are the ‚Äúhigher ups‚Äù if banks owns the company?
[0:56:25] <Izaslayer> while all this is going on Friday fortnite returns and rich might be playing with his new partner
[0:56:30] <Dr_Downzz> Players won't just leave Faze. You are talking about one of the oldest and longest standing Org with more champs in one year then most have gotten in 5
[0:56:34] <Izaslayer> we'll see how the night goes
[0:56:36] <ichiefsi> Banks isn't the only owner
[0:56:37] <CJ3151> @avasack FAX

[0:57:09] <xFTP_Venom> hi
[0:57:15] <avasack> @nicknorman1 but I feel like as the CEO, the decisions like this would ultimately be his
[0:57:19] <Izaslayer> I knew you'd get invite rich you top tier
[0:57:19] <Dr_Downzz> Banks has share holder that are the chair. They will let things come to light if they want the PR
[0:57:21] <jadengocrzyfn> @ichiefsi He the only on fighting publicly
[0:57:21] <squillyummmm> Banks really said some dumb shit like he doesn‚Äôt profit off of Faze or something ??? He‚Äôs literally the owner lmao
[0:57:26] <TBExNeto> Cloak and Tfue gonna make there own org
[0:57:32] <TBExNeto> *their
[0:57:37] <broken8922> True
[0:57:40] <juicedonion> Banks is just pissed that faze will nosedive in popularity when he leaves
[0:57:41] <notmaccas> @iorcus doesn‚Äôt mean shit if he‚Äôs a ‚Äúminor‚Äù he‚Äôs had other contracts and understands them completely, why would you sign something that you don‚Äôt understand then? Again no one else‚Äôs fault but his and he‚Äôs a dickhead for it. HES HAD MORE THEN 1 contract in his life my dude üòÇ no excuse for the guys his fault.
[0:57:43] <Izaslayer> if you bring this kid it'll change his life so I understand testing playing skills 100%
[0:57:48] <CJ3151> bet cloak leaves within the next week max
[0:57:49] <broken8922> He just wants out.
[0:57:53] <chefwangz> PREACH RICH
[0:57:57] <ichiefsi> @jadengocrzyfn you're right but there are still other higher-ups is all I meant
[0:58:07] <squillyummmm> Pretty sure cloak is already out
[0:58:13] <theofficialkinganubis> Yo
[0:58:16] <Dr_Downzz> Cloak and Turn don't have enough pull to make an Org that takes alot
[0:58:17] <squillyummmm> He‚Äôs taken faze out of all his handles
[0:58:17] <CJ3151> turner just wants out he tried leaving 7 months ago and got nothing its like he had no choice but to sue
[0:58:17] <Scuddy> all pro athletes' contracts are available for the public. Why should gamers be any different??
[0:58:23] <jadengocrzyfn> @ichiefsi Yea ik what u meant no worry‚Äôs
[0:58:31] <avasack> @juicedonion well he should be pissed, it‚Äôs his company and bad exposure like this could destroy him. Sucks from his end the most for sure. Tfue just gonna get more viewers than ever
[0:58:34] <StealthFatal> @squillyummmm he said he doesnt make money from the players that are signed. the esports side is not how he earns money
[0:58:37] <TBExNeto> We need KR in the Friday Fortnite please
[0:58:40] <juicedonion> @notmaccas he literally mentions its about helping kids being ripped off
[0:58:42] <ChrisppApples> @TBExNeto Answer 100% honestly... Your on my org "Chrisp" I talk to "Kellogs" and say @TBExNeto is on my org and i can get him to show your products to 100k viewers. "Kellogs" says ok i'll give you $2,000,000 to be with "Chrisp" and have @TBExNeto rep it. I give you $400k and keep the rest. but your doing all the work. Who's the asshole....
[0:58:48] <sarcasmgaming_> everything thats happening is on tfue bro he signed he needs to pay the consequences. thats if hes not lying which he probs is
[0:59:01] <jadengocrzyfn> @dr_downzz They wouldn‚Äôt make a team but they could make a little house full of streamersüòÇ
[0:59:10] <Nightbot> Follow KR on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KingRichard
[0:59:11] <avasack> @scuddy I agree. That‚Äôs an issue that will hopefully be solved after all this. ESports are only going to get bigger so it‚Äôs good that this will set some sort of precedent
[0:59:25] <CJ3151> Banks just needs to let turner leave faze and stop being so dramatic
[0:59:40] <Izaslayer> @chrisppapples perfect
[0:59:41] <CJ3151> Banks knew turner was gonna sue they tried fixing this multiple times
[0:59:42] <avasack> Ok but HighSky situation has yet to be addressed
[0:59:47] <ChrisppApples> @CJ3151 FAZE will say its under new management and probably make a big contract with a new player public to counter this. They have ways to survive. Same with Tfue. they'll figure it out

[1:00:05] <squillyummmm> I can‚Äôt get over how banks has tfue tattooed on him
[1:00:06] <dopeitstwan> It‚Äôs easy to say when you not in the position you would fulfill an unfair 3 year contract yeah ight lol I know I wouldn‚Äôt fortnite might be dead at that point and you would have lost a ton of money.

[1:00:15] <Dr_Downzz> A contract is just that. Rules in how shit is ran. Signing something you don't understand in 2019 is just plain dumb af FACTS!@
[1:00:16] <ichiefsi> What's the highsky situation again? something about underage drinking?
[1:00:22] <Izaslayer> lmaooo code tfue
[1:00:38] <squillyummmm> @ichiefsi highsky is 11 years old lol
[1:00:46] <avasack> @cj3151 poor kid I hope he‚Äôs 13... but he definitely always seemed younger to me. That‚Äôll be huge legal trouble for FaZe. Much more so than turner drinking underage / gambling illegally
[1:00:51] <squillyummmm> And you have to be 13 to or something to be signed
[1:00:55] <ChrisppApples> @Dr_Downzz Slavery ended... that shit aint ok anymore. You can't make 100million pay me 10million then say I should be happy when im doing all the damn work.
[1:00:55] <janzy204> Code tfue
[1:01:05] <trappin_in_tims> Free tfue
[1:01:08] <tnested> Lol
[1:01:08] <Dr_Downzz> @ichiefsi that was tfue's dad all of this shit is. You can see in the man face he don't get it all
[1:01:12] <avasack> @squillyummmm and to qualify for World Cup. Which he‚Äôs gotten at least top 10 almost every week
[1:01:16] <scottjr12> Code tfue
[1:01:18] <CJ3151> @ChrisppApples I mean turner has already grown out of fazes stardom hes the most recognized fortnite pro on the planet, the biggest streamer on twitch etc, even chap said they couldnt have expected to keep turner signed for much longer because tfue is going at an alarming rate
[1:01:21] <ChrisppApples> People are still doing that shit tho.... like it never stopped
[1:01:22] <rentan1> you're Nuts dude
[1:01:31] <wrx_willy> code tsue
[1:01:34] <notmaccas> @avasack you do realise that Tfue got banned from a H1Z1 tournament way before Fortnite was even a thing for being to drunk and talking shit about the CEO right? You guys have no clue üòÇüòÇ
[1:02:09] <ChrisppApples> @CJ3151 they actually might not be able to afford him as a player... that might be the truth. They might not want to lower their profits to support that much cost.

[1:02:38] <cordero17_> Hey everyone kingrichHi kingrichHi
[1:02:39] <trappin_in_tims> Damn we have a bunch of law students and experts in here
[1:02:42] <CJ3151> @ChrisppApples i just feel like turner is worth way more than faze couldve offered
[1:02:44] <RipALip228> yo whats good @KingRichard who you playing with?
[1:02:48] <avasack> @notmaccas that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, the drinking underage thing was never going to be an issue for FaZe. Tfue knows that too, that was just leverage the lawyers were trying to take against FaZe. The only true legal issue they would have is if they truly did sign an underage kid and ‚Äúpressure‚Äù his family to lie about his age
[1:02:51] <ChrisppApples> TFUE is almost twice as big as FAZE on youtube alone.
[1:02:53] <geegh11> faze couldve realeased the contract from the beginning and avoided the whole shit storm if they had nothing to hide
[1:02:55] <avasack> @trappin_in_tims lmao I actually am a law student

[1:03:44] <notmaccas> @chrisppapples and Faze was bigger then Tfue before he got signed ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è
[1:03:49] <CJ3151> Faze just sped up the process
[1:03:54] <nighthawk_md03> theres a tfue vid

[1:04:35] <CJ3151> @notmaccas Faze sped up tfues process but turner was already growing so fast before he signed to faze
[1:04:40] <ChrisppApples> @notmaccas FAZE didn't pickup TFUE out of the kindness of their hearts. They picked him up because they can see his channel was spiking.

[1:05:50] <daequanhairstlye> @laserboyo it's the Maverick skin, came out with update
[1:05:51] <dopeitstwan> Honestly I knew more about tfue than I knew about faze initially but faze got him in the Friday fortnite I guess but I started watching him for the fact he was insane at the game not from faze clout
[1:05:51] <trappin_in_tims> @avasack forreal tho ausHug
[1:06:02] <ChrisppApples> @mozambique_here DUDE I was just thinking that.. like she is BAAAAD!
[1:06:03] <wethoominfacts> lmao
[1:06:04] <notmaccas> @chrisppapples yeah I understand that iv been watching the dude for years way before Fortnite but Faze did help him? Edits his YouTube channel, the guy didn‚Äôt even have YouTube before Faze really so you can‚Äôt sit their and say Faze didn‚Äôt actually help him, even if it was for money, everyone does everything for money, but again you can‚Äôt sit their and say they didn‚Äôt help him at all

[1:06:51] <avasack> Some people think they can hide behind their screens, sucks when they‚Äôre shitty
[1:06:53] <Dr_Downzz> Turner was blown up by faze that is truth. Any other Org would have never did Tfue right to
[1:06:54] <juicedonion> Every faze member should average 50k viewers then becuase they got signed LUL great logic
[1:06:57] <cordero17_> @i_am_l3gend_1020 New Jordan skin
[1:07:14] <lcceyy> Would anybody agree Friday fornite blew tfue up?

[1:07:31] <Izaslayer> Tfue blew himself up
[1:07:33] <i_am_l3gend_1020> No the kid hes playing with lol
[1:07:34] <TyraBtw> tfue has every right to let everyone know about his contract. just because faze "gave him a platform" doesnt mean he cant stand up to them about a horrible contract
[1:07:37] <lcceyy> and why is the only reason keem star let tfue in the Friday fortnite cus of faze cuz he wasn‚Äôt big
[1:07:41] <lcceyy> faze made tfue
[1:07:43] <LftLaneHammrDwn> hello kingdom, what's cracka lackin'!
[1:07:44] <nottimmy44> Yes and tfue would not have been in ff without faze wake the fuck ip
[1:07:44] <aIpxca> Anyone else feel for cloak in this shitstorm?
[1:07:45] <HeyImXamius> @Izaslayer nah he didnt
[1:07:47] <jadengocrzyfn> Banks is looking real shady rn
[1:07:49] <Izaslayer> Thats like Richard bringing Sesci and sesci playing ass are you gonna follow him?
[1:07:51] <avasack> @juicedonion lol that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. Because there are a lot of FaZe guys that are really good that get less than 1k viewers all the time... replays, thiefs, etc. and they didn‚Äôt blow up just because of FaZe?
[1:07:54] <Izaslayer> Ok then
[1:08:01] <ChrisppApples> @notmaccas they helped but I refused to give someone credit for taking advantage of a sure bet. They saw he was blowing up. Why didn't they get other people instead? They were after TFUE. Think of it this way. If I knew you had a lotto ticket... what would I do to make you happen. Knowing I could get a piece of it. Dont for 1 second think someone was just trying to help TFUE... he was a blank check.
[1:08:07] <Izaslayer> Yall in denial bruh
[1:08:10] <BuzzTTV_> without Friday fortnite people probably would of been like tfue who?
[1:08:27] <HeyImXamius> You guys have to notice... there are people that are just as GOOD as Tfue but havent been noticed yet, people would KILL to be on a team like that and get viewers/clout. U gotta know ur roots and respect em.
[1:08:32] <trappin_in_tims> Free tfue till it‚Äôs backwards
[1:08:32] <Izaslayer> I been following faze since cod was fortnite and im not blind eyeing it

[1:08:57] <orbitalbasher83> You got this king

[1:09:09] <HeyImXamius> @CJ3151 no he wasnt. look at that graph thing

[1:09:52] <HeyImXamius> @juicedonion but they did LUL
[1:09:54] <BuzzTTV_> facts
[1:09:55] <CJ3151> Faze couldnt have expected to keep tfue contained after seeing how fast he was growing
[1:09:58] <cordero17_> Everyone in here to watch king rich or to talk about tfue? Like this is crazy y‚Äôall need to chill
[1:10:00] <waterfloatie> FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ
[1:10:00] <spel91> fornite blew up tfue, end of.
[1:10:05] <avasack> What about the other FaZe guys that didn‚Äôt blow up? They‚Äôre awesome players, but turners own grind and personality and play style is what got him where he is. There‚Äôs a reason he has 50k viewers all the time and other FaZe guys don‚Äôt even get half that... and it wasn‚Äôt just fazes doing idk
[1:10:08] <RushersBR> tfueTH üêçüêçüêçüêçüêç
[1:10:11] <Izaslayer> Im fire with controller but honestly grew up gaming on pc
[1:10:20] <LftLaneHammrDwn> I think everyone needs to take a step back and give their opinion after all the facts come out, I still haven't found a official statement from Tfue, so we are all speculating like a bunch of girls
[1:10:34] <Izaslayer> When I return these lobbies will feel the wrath
[1:10:34] <BuzzTTV_> tfue signed the contract he knew what he was doing
[1:10:45] <Dr_Downzz> @ChrisppApples Bro uhhhh Tim, Ceez, Summit1G like there were loads making it before ever had a chance
[1:10:46] <avasack> @lftlanehammrdwn he released a brief statement on YouTube about an hour ago
[1:10:48] <ChrisppApples> ok ttv kid you right
[1:10:50] <trappin_in_tims> So im guessing the patriots made Tom Brady right ? And Scotty pippen made Michael Jordan ? Since faze made tfue lol either way he would still be the player he is rn
[1:10:56] <spel91> @LftLaneHammrDwn go to his twitter then
[1:10:58] <BuzzTTV_> he should just finish the contract then dip
[1:11:01] <Kensaya> Yeah true also who cares about that dude. I know nothing about him and could care less
[1:11:01] <juicedonion> @HeyImXamius every faze member is no where near his level. Tfue won nearly every tourney from the beginning
[1:11:01] <waterfloatie> HSWP HSWP HSWP
[1:11:02] <Izaslayer> He SiGNeD ThE COntrAcT
[1:11:04] <RushersBR> @buzzttv_ That is true
[1:11:05] <IC3Dlogan> @buzzttv_ Nobody reads contracts, and he wasn‚Äôt expecting to make much at the start
[1:11:09] <kinglkerrigan> @trappin_in_tims how....if ninja didnt mention turner all the time saying how good he was then the views would of never came in
[1:11:13] <TyraBtw> @BuzzTTV_ dude, youre naive LUL shutup
[1:11:14] <LftLaneHammrDwn> @avasack ill be back then, lol
[1:11:17] <CJ3151> banks is making himself look like a clown on twitter
[1:11:20] <deathkittentoker> nah
[1:11:20] <IC3Dlogan> #ReleaseTheContract
[1:11:23] <Izaslayer> Facts
[1:11:29] <ChrisppApples> @Dr_Downzz say that again
[1:11:30] <LftLaneHammrDwn> @spel91 , don't do Twitter
[1:11:38] <squillyummmm> Lmfao just shot him down üíÄ
[1:11:43] <CJ3151> tfue was young and wanting exposure so he signed to faze
[1:11:45] <rilloxmoe> @KingRichard ya but even a small contract wouldnt you at least have a lawyer look over it especially if you aint got shit yet
[1:11:46] <deathkittentoker> When you sign a contract, you best have your lawyers or hire lawyers to look at it.
[1:11:47] <BuzzTTV_> but he is also put lies about faze like wtf
[1:11:52] <ChrisppApples> @BuzzTTV_ Would take the shittiest DEAL PERIOD
[1:11:54] <1wilshire> lol contract could be predatory and ya'll dont even care
[1:11:55] <deathkittentoker> Nah
[1:11:56] <HeyImXamius> @ChrisppApples trust me bro, there were people that were fucking goooood man. they were getting under 10 viewers.
[1:11:56] <CJ3151> now he sees how bad that contract is and wants out its that easy
[1:11:56] <nyquanyewest> I wish chipotle would send me a contract
[1:12:01] <BuzzTTV_> forcing him to drink and shit
[1:12:04] <TyraBtw> all of that twitter fingers Banks is doing will backfire in court
[1:12:05] <trappin_in_tims> @kinglkerrigan u gotta be a ninja fanboy to think that
[1:12:08] <avasack> Yeah signing with FaZe changed his life! But honestly signing with any org and getting exposure through Friday fortnite would‚Äôve had the same outcome? Maybe not
[1:12:16] <Dr_Downzz> Bro uhhhh Tim, Ceez, Summit1G like there were loads making it before ever had a chance
[1:12:23] <IC3Dlogan> @cj3151 Lol he‚Äôs using the drama for views. So when FaZe gets shutdown he will have money to live off. lmao
[1:12:27] <deathkittentoker> Because that's how contracts work
[1:12:27] <Izaslayer> Id sign for free chick fil a and 100k 3 year deal rn
[1:12:27] <odds> Do you have a lawyer look at your contract when you sign your first contract at like mcdonalds? nahh
[1:12:29] <blovvw88> wait until all the facts are out. siting with one side at the moment is not smart. Matt from 100 thieves did that and felt stupid for it.
[1:12:33] <CJ3151> @avasack not as fast as he grew but he wouldve blew up regardless
[1:12:34] <rilloxmoe> @KingRichard tru but 80 20 in the orgs favor is kinda sus
[1:12:34] <deathkittentoker> LMFAO
[1:12:35] <BuzzTTV_> even tho if I signed I would stay till the end of the contract then dip @kingrichard
[1:12:36] <ichiefsi> Shit I'd sign a contract for 80/20 for one hour of Faze income hahaha
[1:12:38] <nottimmy44> No one gives credit to cloak he also won the tourneys dumbasses
[1:12:45] <ChrisppApples> @HeyImXamius they can play in the cup and prove it then have a org sign you for 20% of your earnings when you weren't even on a team when you qualified
[1:12:54] <br076_maximus> i think ur on the wrong side richard
[1:12:55] <deathkittentoker> TFUE is a joke, he does nothing but complain anyway.
[1:12:56] <trappin_in_tims> Ava is my lawyer
[1:12:56] <ChrisppApples> @ichiefsi THAT IS THE POINT
[1:13:05] <Izaslayer> My g i would sign for a fuckin walmart gift card and 100k free groceries fuck it dood
[1:13:06] <ChrisppApples> Most people WOULD SIGN TFUES CONTRACT
[1:13:07] <stopputtingttvinyourname> This seems a bit personal to you
[1:13:09] <wzheng536> freaking 3 year contract man
[1:13:12] <IC3Dlogan> @deathkittentoker And you‚Äôre a seven year old
[1:13:12] <thatmoondude> So whos side are you guys on? Lets start a small poll
[1:13:20] <avasack> @nottimmy44 well but see he‚Äôs with FaZe too and doesn‚Äôt get the viewers Tfue does. So doesn‚Äôt that kind of say it had a lot more to do with Tfue himself than with FaZe?
[1:13:21] <ChrisppApples> Fuck a lawyer... its FAZE!
[1:13:21] <Izaslayer> I say that to say when you up and coming you do what you gotta do
[1:13:23] <ichiefsi> @chrisppapples *everyone
[1:13:24] <RaccoonsDead> @kingrichard it‚Äôs really spicy in here lol
[1:13:25] <nottimmy44> I honestly don‚Äôt know why people watch tfue sure he‚Äôs skilled but god damn he‚Äôs annoying
[1:13:26] <CJ3151> @thatmoondude turner 1000%
[1:13:27] <Ave86> @br076_maximus There is no side. Neither of them pay you
[1:13:27] <IC3Dlogan> @thatmoondude Turners
[1:13:28] <ChrisppApples> EVERYONE
[1:13:29] <ChrisppApples> lol
[1:13:35] <ZigZack> dragons awakening
[1:13:37] <TyraBtw> im not picking sides until they release this contract
[1:13:39] <br076_maximus> when tfue blew up and grew massive, they offered to change the contract but he refused to talk about it
[1:13:40] <RG_Fetam> Wish I could get 20 viewers LOL love the stream richard
[1:13:43] <deathkittentoker> @IC3Dlogan 24, work hard for my money, and don't complain about what life has handed to me. :)
[1:13:47] <nyquanyewest> Lawyers don‚Äôt have clout
[1:13:48] <Dr_Downzz> Everyone sign's a contract to grow from 5Head
[1:13:48] <JackSlayerxz> @br076_maximus wrong side? you are responsible for signing the contract and gettin a lawyer to review to make sure you not gettin ripped off lol
[1:13:50] <CJ3151> turner isnt making this personal at all, banks is making it personal
[1:13:50] <KmIeLL> tfue did nothng wrong. he had no contract with faze and just blew up on his own.
[1:13:51] <BuzzTTV_> but do you really think faze is robbing his money?
[1:13:51] <RushersBR> That is his problem, if he doesnt had the money so read all
[1:13:57] <ChrisppApples> People can't put themselves back then before this. Before this issue. ITS A FAZE CONTRACT. WHO THE FUCK NOT SIGNING?
[1:14:01] <rjjryan1> keemstar silent on twitter is really odd during all this
[1:14:02] <nottimmy44> No because cloak barely streams and wasn‚Äôt encouraged by all the faze clan members to vlog and all that shot
[1:14:06] <bigloc831> Banks isn‚Äôt mad at the contract he‚Äôs mad that he had no heads up from someone he called family. Tfue doing this is basically shat all over banks
[1:14:06] <ichiefsi> Dude was making maybe 25k a year and 80/20 to be on Faze... hell ya
[1:14:11] <IC3Dlogan> @deathkittentoker And you‚Äôre getting mad because he complains? Lol
[1:14:11] <dopeitstwan> @buzzttv_ keep in mind it‚Äôs a video game that might die and 3 years you going to leave millions on the table for loyalty to Someone that got you in an unfair contract to begin with?
[1:14:12] <nottimmy44> Banks literally helped tfue so much
[1:14:13] <Nightbot> Follow KR on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KingRichard
[1:14:15] <kinglkerrigan> @trappin_in_tims nahh i actually view tfues content more then anyones. its just commen sense. When ninja was killing it daily thats when tfue started blowing up
[1:14:22] <CJ3151> Banks is making this all personal not tfue
[1:14:25] <cmgquan> Tfue got money regardless he jus trying to make this example for the next people that come after him who don‚Äôt got it like he do
[1:14:27] <CJ3151> turner just wants out bro
[1:14:30] <MmmTacos1> nothing is definite until it is actually in court, it's not like Faze has released there acounting books it has all just been statements so far. so everyone is just speculating rn
[1:14:30] <IC3Dlogan> @ichiefsi Who
[1:14:32] <avasack> Is the contract supposed to come out tonight?
[1:14:53] <CJ3151> @avasack "soon" according to banks
[1:14:55] <rilloxmoe> @KingRichard also i feel like in that situation if you gonna get a lawyer to look at your contract he should handle all of the offers
[1:14:56] <BuzzTTV_> all I'm saying is tfue fked up now he is trying to lie to get out and that's tuff
[1:15:00] <br076_maximus> i think he got wrong people around him who are just trying to squeze every penny out of tfue (his family probably like banks said)

[1:15:08] <thehuntercore> Hi
[1:15:16] <RushersBR> Now I can sign every contract without reading if I dont have money to pay for someone to read for me, good to know @kingrichard
[1:15:20] <CJ3151> @frostywhite banks is making this way too personal
[1:15:28] <sweetpotatoefries> drogon left kings landing and came to fortnite smh
[1:15:32] <avasack> THIS IS WHERE DROGON FLEW TO
[1:15:39] <nyquanyewest> Buncha contract pros in chat
[1:15:40] <RaccoonsDead> Lmao^
[1:15:41] <wzheng536> the contract has to be terrible for tfue to win legally
[1:15:42] <avasack> @sweetpotatoefries lmaooo same thought ^^^
[1:15:46] <mostdopekyliee> While everyone talking bout to contract, faze, and tfue, im just chillen bc im just waiting until someone wins and why they win.
[1:15:48] <frostywhite> @CJ3151 i dont think so
[1:15:51] <ChrisppApples> That contract could contain a handjob clause and people would sign and give them handjobs. Once you outgrow the need to give handjobs you DEFF gonna renegotiate and make a big deal about it. EVERYONE is exploitable at first... then they arent and you have to give them what they are worth when they find out lol
[1:15:53] <signup424> @chat FaZe didnt make tfue but he was averaging 100 viewers every stream before FaZe signed him and banks convinced cloak to play with him even when cloak thought he was trash
[1:16:02] <IC3Dlogan> @cj3151 True. But it‚Äôs all on him since he‚Äôs the owner. But I‚Äôm with Tfue

[1:16:35] <IC3Dlogan> @signup424 cLoak said him saying tfue was trash wasn‚Äôt true
[1:16:41] <nicholashtth> cloak asked to be released also
[1:16:43] <kinglkerrigan> @trappin_in_tims yeah faZe being in front of his name helped 100%. But if it wasnt for the ninja so called beef and him being real good he would never be where hes at. just another kid signed to faZe

[1:17:53] <squillyummmm> There‚Äôs a firefight and HighSky was caught in the middle of it
[1:17:54] <geegh11> the new smg
[1:17:59] <CJ3151> @signup424 cloak intially didnt think they needed tfue but never called him trash
[1:18:11] <avasack> TAC AR
[1:18:16] <IC3Dlogan> @cj3151 Yep
[1:18:17] <dualdavids> You can‚Äôt GET OUT OF A CONTRACT lol.... this is adult life... ask ATT or Direct TV to get out of a contract? See how they laugh.
[1:18:17] <BuzzTTV_> banks even got a code tfue tattoo like smh
[1:18:30] <LftLaneHammrDwn> morale of the story, read contracts! be it any kind of loan, rental agreement, etc. otherwise you will have to hold your dick infornt of everyone, and it turns out to be this cluster fuck
[1:18:30] <darkomorrison100> Always bring lawyer when signing shit you know nothing wbout
[1:18:32] <ZigZack> look for the dragon
[1:18:37] <hutupcuzyourbreathstanks> @chrisppapples 80% handjobs 20% blowjobs?
[1:18:38] <blabafat> WOW classic? More like WOW that game sucks!
[1:18:38] <ChrisppApples> @RushersBR no you sign because its your one chance to get on an org and you think its a good opportunite and maybe giving handjobs doesnt seem so bad at the time
[1:18:41] <br076_maximus> anyone else who has the face mask thing on the left top corner in front of the health bar?
[1:18:42] <Itscenturion19> Respect
[1:18:44] <TyraBtw> @signup424 re read cloak's statement before you make yourself look like an idiot
[1:18:46] <RaccoonsDead> Banks is toxic and manipulative. Always has been
[1:18:51] <avasack> @buzzttv_ yeaaahh that‚Äôs unfortunate :( but shows he truly adored him I guess. Or drunken laugh since he has a lot of tats
[1:18:52] <br076_maximus> i hope it will be moved
[1:18:52] <IC3Dlogan> @buzzttv_ Lol that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt get tattoos that you‚Äôll regret
[1:18:53] <BuzzTTV_> cloak said he couldn't build only shoot
[1:18:53] <daequanhairstlye> speaking of John wick, who seen it
[1:18:54] <funkycyborg> @dualdavids i mean you can get out of ATT and Direct tv, just have to pay the early termination fees lol bad comparison

[1:19:08] <daequanhairstlye> @kingrichard have u seen John wick
[1:19:11] <rilloxmoe> @ChrisppApples even if he signed it in a sit down business type setting and looked it over like you said he outgrew the contract and has every right to try and get a new deal the way theyre going about it idk
[1:19:13] <bigwill15903> A
[1:19:14] <DurrelWeastCoast> @chrisppapples Who‚Äôs giving away free handjobs? I mean no one can beat me better than I can beat myself
[1:19:14] <CJ3151> banks needs to stop making this so personal its all about business not being buddy buddy
[1:19:20] <signup424> @cj3151 @cj3151 once again you ain't going to call your best friend trash

[1:19:44] <IC3Dlogan> #ReleaseTheContract
[1:19:47] <dualdavids> @funkycyborg Let‚Äôs see Tfues co tract and what it takes to get out... sorry lol but my comparison is still valid
[1:19:51] <ChrisppApples> @rilloxmoe he tried for months to work it out and said he didn't blindside anyone. they all new he was trying to get out of that contract.
[1:19:51] <RushersBR> @chrisppapples So that is my problem, if I signed I accepted the handjob too
[1:19:56] <BuzzTTV_> @cj3151 but he saw tfue as homie and that he would never leave so he showed him love by getting a tattoo lol
[1:20:04] <utahmoe2739> #ReleaseTheKraken
[1:20:05] <sweetpotatoefries> damn y'all really tight about this contract situation huh
[1:20:09] <Izaslayer> STORM WARRIORS
[1:20:21] <funkycyborg> @dualdavids i mean i agree with you about tfue, just not the att and direct tv lol those are simple to get out of
[1:20:22] <darkomorrison100> I loved that kid this I made this kid this like shut up bro we talking big Benjamin‚Äôs here ain‚Äôt no feelings involved
[1:20:23] <CJ3151> @BuzzTTV_ rule 1 never get someones name on ur body unless its a loved one
[1:20:24] <laserboyo> I would feel shitty too if I was Banks
[1:20:25] <Kensaya> How long is this contract?
[1:20:26] <BMCM4716> A tattoo regarding another man lmao
[1:20:27] <ChrisppApples> @RushersBR but when you win damn near everything you play and make millions giving handjobs aint your thing anymore and you need a new contract
[1:20:29] <Izaslayer> Campfire needed
[1:20:32] <nyquanyewest> @sweetpotatoefries I‚Äôm not tight hamzSus
[1:20:46] <avasack> @kensaya like another 2 years

[1:21:20] <signup424> @cj3151 even if he didnt call him trash he still didnt want to play with him and who convensed him banks
[1:21:22] <whitehammer022> #ReleaseTheContract

[1:21:58] <ChrisppApples> @RushersBR Thats where your wrong. You have legal power to demand and out. You don't have to sign and get rapped for years.
[1:22:00] <rayy_keith> tfue looked so weird making that vid it was like he was reading a script
[1:22:01] <Tfue_ReleaseTheContract> <----
[1:22:02] <Izaslayer> Survived TriHard
[1:22:04] <funkycyborg> @dualdavids lol... its okay. but youre right though, going to be hard af for tfue, especially cause he agreed to the terms of signing with the team
[1:22:06] <hutupcuzyourbreathstanks> Fuck that contract bullshit... I just want my meat beat! # 80% Meat 20# Beat
[1:22:09] <avasack> @signup424 he had just underestimated him at first and they had bad blood from previous games. I think banks tried to throw cloak under the bus a little with that
[1:22:14] <darkomorrison100> It‚Äôs like selling your soul all you read is money and hoes all of a sudden you a slave
[1:22:16] <signup424> tfue a back stabber ain't no changing it
[1:22:21] <CJ3151> oh yall dead dead
[1:22:50] <ChrisppApples> @RushersBR he tried to settle out of court, now he wants a court to decide this shit is legal not illegal he aint do nothing WRONG.
[1:22:54] <signup424> @avasack even if he did cloak changed his mind because of banks

[1:24:34] <ChrisppApples> @rilloxmoe that sucks to have to do that but its not illegal it's his right to fight it. It's actually a good way to say your serious.
[1:24:48] <RushersBR> @chrisppapples And imagine if tfue wasnt that good, FaZe would like to kick him, but the 3 years would protect Tfue, contracts should be fair and protect both parts

[1:26:01] <rilloxmoe> ya i mean the bottom line is the contract isnt something that will work for either side its sad it has to be made public but hopefully the ones who actually car can stay civil and not have to choose sides
[1:26:02] <YazzLivee> @whitehammer022 bro its not a 2second thing to release it bro.

[1:26:42] <LftLaneHammrDwn> @bennettboss1 i think the video put Tfue into a good light, definitely made him look human, instead of the ass he portraits himself to be when he streams
[1:26:47] <hqwizard00> @kingrichard are u playing Fortnite Friday? Wanna see u destroy!

[1:26:58] <pistolmaravich> am i the only one that‚Äôs kinda baffled faze could only bring tfue two brand deals? that‚Äôs gotta be some shit tfue only made 300k from that if he was solo he could had made wayyy more off brand deals
[1:26:58] <FIawe> shwag
[1:26:59] <ChrisppApples> @RushersBR You make fair contracts that allow for growth when you're doing GOOD business. You say things like if you're 3x bigger in 6 months we'll negotiate. This contract was BAD business from what Summit looked at and what FAZE posted themselves.

[1:27:50] <rafa_rz> @KingRichard CHECK that new picture in discord (memes) LUL
[1:27:50] <mrgrevious1> Think it through: if Tfue‚Äôs value to faze in new contract is 1 mil and no splits, then that‚Äôs what he has basically been worth for the past year...but he got no money just clout. Not equal
[1:27:57] <ChrisppApples> @KingRichard WAY bigger than TFUE I know the orgs are consulting LAWYERS RIGHT NOW!!!!!

[1:28:17] <RushersBR> @chrisppapples ‚ÄúGood contract‚Äù is subjective
[1:28:17] <wrx_willy> just a big hoax to get fortnite fridays backüòÇ
[1:28:19] <pistolmaravich> @kingrichard is it weird faze could only bring tfue 2 brand deals in over a year? tfue made 300k when if he was solo he could had made so much more
[1:28:23] <BuzzTTV_> tfue says they forced him to move in the mansion and if he didn't tfue would have not met corrina.
[1:28:24] <perez541> Are you on a pro team?

[1:32:26] <mrgrevious1> This will not look good for faze long term. They are in gaming bubble. The splits don‚Äôt match other industries. Why does faze need enough profit margin to have clout houses. How does that help gamers? Seriously

[1:35:18] <KingTurtleMan> @chrisppapples also one of the most toxic ceezW
[1:35:21] <get_schwifty_23> pub stomping is much more fun
[1:35:32] <hutupcuzyourbreathstanks> I eat ass
[1:35:33] <pistolmaravich> @chrisppapples true i mean the first time i heard of tfue was back on h1 but i‚Äôm in the minority for that i guess
[1:35:34] <mrgrevious1> @onethirty Even the language already released is vague. Does ‚Äúappearances‚Äù cover attending World Cup in nyc or is that winnings.
[1:35:39] <king_yamii> why hasn't aimbotcalvin streamed lately?
[1:35:42] <Sevyeire> Zombies BrokeBack
[1:35:45] <Flam3truns> Thoughts of ur g305?
[1:35:54] <BuzzTTV_> John wick was amazing
[1:36:11] <ChrisppApples> @KingTurtleMan That's not what's in argument tho.. Rich and TFUE beefed a bit, but you gotta be able to step back and look a situations with clear eyes.
[1:36:16] <nottimmy44> Are u playing in the code red apex tourney Friday? Chat?
[1:36:17] <daequanhairstlye> @buzzttv_ faxxxxxx
[1:36:26] <kinglkerrigan> @ChrisppApples Ninjas success and the success of twitch is my Tfue is huge.
[1:36:29] <pistolmaravich> the king richard tfue beef was settled over a game of billiards
[1:36:32] <Bismo_Funyuns_10> How old is this kid?
[1:36:32] <Izaslayer> this a w i can feel it
[1:36:49] <RaccoonsDead> @buzzttv_ which John wick movie was your favorite?
[1:36:49] <Izaslayer> Jus stay together late game yall got dis
[1:36:51] <OneThirty> @mrgrevious1 Well I don‚Äôt think they are paying anyone to attend, so there wouldn‚Äôt be anything for Faze to collect unless it was prize money
[1:36:52] <ChrisppApples> @kinglkerrigan say that again lol
[1:37:09] <BuzzTTV_> @daequanhairstlye best movie I've seen in awhile besides endgame
[1:37:25] <nottimmy44> How about fortnite pro am is king going to that
[1:37:29] <queenjeebies> i like the cape/jacket on the skin but it gets so annoying tbh
[1:37:31] <mrgrevious1> @kinglkerrigan Not even ninja. Just combo of twitch popularity rise st same time as Fortnite boom
[1:37:52] <BuzzTTV_> @deadraccoon56 number 1
[1:38:01] <nottimmy44> Nah ninja is the only reason I ever heard of twitch and countless others
[1:38:03] <Izaslayer> geez the loot
[1:38:07] <Izaslayer> is beautiful
[1:38:16] <daequanhairstlye> @buzzttv_ pretty much endgame was üî•üî•, John wick was üî•üî•üî•üî•. There's gonna be another one, remember the ending
[1:38:24] <Izaslayer> I heard of twitch cause of dj akademiks
[1:38:24] <MattFl___> fortnite KR > apex KR
[1:38:38] <Izaslayer> I was like i wanna watch fortnite went into browse and found KR
[1:38:48] <BuzzTTV_> @daequanhairstlye faxxx and of course
[1:38:53] <Izaslayer> First gamer on twitch i ever watched
[1:38:54] <ChrisppApples> @pistolmaravich twitch took a change back then when Ninja did the drake stream and it created more viewers and subs than ever. Everyone was blowing up and orgs were grabbing the best they saw when they saw the players starting to take off. A lot of the hype wasn't because of the orgs.. it was more people more subs more sponsors and more money coming to twitch FAST
[1:39:03] <spel91> cant wait for twitch to get as big as yt
[1:39:04] <Nightbot> Amazon Prime members get a free Twitch subscription every month. Link Your Account Here: twitch.amazon.com/prime and subscribe to KR for free!
[1:39:09] <mrgrevious1> @onethirty Agreed. Bad example maybe. But it‚Äôs that kind of stuff that will be argued
[1:39:23] <BurnsyJB> You are da goat bro
[1:39:25] <KingTurtleMan> @chrisppapples no doubt, but the fact is that tfue is being so shady about this whole thing. If he came out and laid out some facts it would be different. His character on stream is evident off stream too. He‚Äôs immature and toxic
[1:39:26] <BuzzTTV_> rumor says there will be 5 John wick movies
[1:39:28] <MattFl___> @ChrisppApples all about da $
[1:39:42] <Izaslayer> @KingRichard you broke my game watching v card
[1:39:46] <OneThirty> @chrisppapples Big reqFax . I don‚Äôt think orgs had much of an influence at all until later
[1:39:50] <coolchilllin> What GPU does kingrichard use?
[1:39:50] <ChrisppApples> @mrgrevious1 People are missing that Point TWITCH Took off taking players up with it. It wasn't the ORGS.
[1:39:59] <VISH_PWND> Hey chat, how many hours do you spend on average on twitch a day?
[1:40:00] <Izaslayer> I mean ak streamed 2k but that was jus to talk shit lol he not a gamer
[1:40:05] <daequanhairstlye> @buzzttv_ my favorite parts was when the dogs got to fight and half the end when he killed all those guys
[1:40:10] <almightygod4> When they're Making a Mulan movie but no Shang PepeHands
[1:40:12] <ChrisppApples> @coolchilllin 9900K and 9980XE
[1:40:14] <pistolmaravich> @chrisppapples a huge thing that could of avoided all of this is if epic was clear there would be nothing with squads.. people wouldn‚Äôt had been trying to build teams if that was the case
[1:40:23] <BuzzTTV_> the action in the new John was God like
[1:40:38] <KingTurtleMan> @chrisppapples of course we dont have all the info on either side. And we dont know what is true and not. But tfue being shady and non-verbal about anything is making him look like the bad guy. Im not one to take sides without facts but i need some facts from him lol
[1:40:44] <BuzzTTV_> wick*
[1:40:46] <RaccoonsDead> I still haven‚Äôt seen any John wick movie :(
[1:40:55] <OneThirty> @mrgrevious1 of course. Contracts are pretty much worded in ways so the average person won‚Äôt be able to understand it, well all of it.
[1:41:00] <almightygod4> @DeadRaccoon56 Watch it now LUL
[1:41:02] <daequanhairstlye> @deadraccoon56 üòëüòëüòëüòë
[1:41:06] <pistolmaravich> @kingturtleman tfue not speaking has been best.. banks if this goes to court will have fucked himself
[1:41:14] <almightygod4> @DeadRaccoon56 Or tomorrow LUL
[1:41:25] <BuzzTTV_> @deadraccoon56 you missing out man please watch them they are amazing A+++
[1:41:30] <kodak_black15> he's being non verbal because whatever he says will be used against him in court @KingTurtleMan
[1:41:31] <RaccoonsDead> I‚Äôm at work rn lol I shouldn‚Äôt even be watching the stream
[1:41:38] <ChrisppApples> @pistolmaravich kingrichFax FAZE was looking for a 4th because the money was in FORNITE and expected Growth. It wasn't FAZE it was the platform. Faze was a good ORG im not saying they did nothing but TFUE didn't happen because of FAZE he was already happening and FAZE saw it.
[1:41:42] <OneThirty> @pistolmaravich Even so, orgs have easily signed more than 4 players per org though
[1:41:43] <mrgrevious1> @chrisppapples Yes. If it wasn‚Äôt ninja it would be someone else. Millions of fortnite players were going to want to watch someone. Most semi-new to gaming and never heard/don‚Äôt care about org
[1:41:48] <daequanhairstlye> @deadraccoon56 ah man
[1:41:54] <PrettyBoyRicoSuave> PrettyBoyRicoSuave subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months!

[1:42:23] <KingTurtleMan> @pistolmaravich im not saying breach his contract but explain what is going on in the least. The fact that it has taken him this long to do anything is so bad for him
[1:42:25] <Izaslayer> Youll come up soon dude jus try your hardest
[1:42:33] <mrgrevious1> @pistolmaravich Great point about squads. Really, epic in general has been horrid in its part
[1:42:37] <mason94s> bot you are
[1:42:43] <Izaslayer> @Genesis0109 that emote lmao
[1:42:47] <RaccoonsDead> I‚Äôve gotten in trouble for watching twitch streams already but I don‚Äôt care anymore
[1:42:50] <queenjeebies> tyga? TYGA?!
[1:42:56] <BuzzTTV_> @deadraccoon56 I feel you
[1:43:05] <daequanhairstlye> The thing about John wick is that with the action it was actually funny at the same time, hope the new one come out soon
[1:43:09] <Izaslayer> there yall go
[1:43:11] <pistolmaravich> @kingturtleman i see what you mean in public eye tfue looks bad.. in the court thou banks looks dumb
[1:43:14] <ChrisppApples> @mrgrevious1 I think NINJA is to be Credited fully tho. He played with Drake but he pushed the envelope and did mad work to push Twitch. Without that ninja stream twitch would be different.
[1:43:29] <almightygod4> @daequanhairstlye John Wick 4?
[1:43:30] <OneThirty> @pistolmaravich reqFax
[1:43:32] <dankest12> its past his bed time
[1:43:39] <bigjustin69x> @pistolmaravich very true
[1:43:44] <RaccoonsDead> Shit I might fuck around this weekend and watch them all
[1:43:45] <daequanhairstlye> @almightygod4 definitely
[1:43:49] <BuzzTTV_> @daequanhairstlye the Asian guy was hilarious in John wick 3
[1:43:51] <Supplier> yoinked
[1:44:09] <Izaslayer> Dude is 18 i believe dank
[1:44:11] <OneThirty> Ninja basically made twitch as mainstream as Netflix.
[1:44:18] <Nightbot> Follow KR on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KingRichard
[1:44:22] <mrgrevious1> @chrisppapples Small point, but didn‚Äôt noah465 make a top 10 list with Tfue at top Before Faze. That‚Äôs first time I heard of him.
[1:44:26] <KingTurtleMan> @pistolmaravich for sure. Banks was way too emotionally driven and said too much too.
[1:44:29] <pistolmaravich> shit every twitch streamer should give ninja 10% LUL
[1:44:37] <irknova> What up King Richard
[1:44:46] <Izaslayer> Shraggy?
[1:44:49] <hutupcuzyourbreathstanks> Crinja
[1:44:50] <frostywhite> is twitch actually mainstream
[1:44:51] <almightygod4> Once Disney+ comes out I'm barley gonna use Netflix LUL
[1:44:56] <daequanhairstlye> @buzzttv_ oh yeah him and John wick would've been a great duo
[1:45:02] <BuzzTTV_> @deadraccoon56 watch them when ever you can you wont be disappointed
[1:45:02] <OneThirty> @frostywhite 100%
[1:45:02] <Spaaceghostpurrp> Is this a random
[1:45:04] <pistolmaravich> i would say twitch is as mainstream as netflix
[1:45:09] <almightygod4> @frostywhite Yeah
[1:45:12] <Lapp_> Ninja invented the internet
[1:45:12] <Nightbot> Join our partnered discord server now! https://discordapp.com/invite/ZUcEc8e
[1:45:17] <Spaaceghostpurrp> Who he playing w?
[1:45:26] <frostywhite> i been watchin since before fortnite i thought it was still like taboo
[1:45:30] <spel91> @pistolmaravich not even close lol a lot of people still dont know about twitch
[1:45:42] <dankest12> if he's 18 he can make his own decisions
[1:45:43] <pistolmaravich> @spel91 monthly viewership says enough thou
[1:45:44] <KingTurtleMan> @pistolmaravich twitch should give ninja 10% ceezMagine ceezLUL
[1:45:52] <Izaslayer> @sesci
[1:45:53] <OneThirty> That‚Äôs why Netflix is going to come out with live-streaming, to compete with twitch and YouTube
[1:45:54] <ChrisppApples> @mrgrevious1 I don't know what point your trying to make. on a side note @noah465 isn't anywhere near TFUE and they were together so what happened?
[1:45:54] <mrgrevious1> @chrisppapples Yeah. Totally agree with that. Few others would have taken advantage like ninja and tried to be the leader he tried to be. Not a fanboy but they got lucky with ninja
[1:46:04] <inasty23> Shrimp n grits!
[1:46:08] <RaccoonsDead> @buzzttv_ yeah I will for sure, I can easily borrow the movies from any friend
[1:46:10] <BuzzTTV_> @daequanhairstlye yah they would have.that man could fight
[1:46:16] <almightygod4> Netflix is having Livestream? LUL
[1:46:35] <pistolmaravich> netflix even said twitch is their biggest competition @spel91
[1:46:41] <OneThirty> @almightygod4 It‚Äôs coming. Not out yet though
[1:46:49] <BuzzTTV_> @deadraccoon56 bet :D
[1:46:52] <coltonhellwig> Why can't you check how many kills your teammates have anymore?
[1:46:55] <Kensaya> Facebook had a gaming platform like twitch as well
[1:46:56] <OneThirty> @pistolmaravich Exactly!
[1:46:57] <frostywhite> i stopped watching netflix for twitch LOL
[1:47:00] <Kensaya> Has

[1:47:16] <OneThirty> @kensaya But Facebook as a whole is falling off.
[1:47:28] <frostywhite> these arena duos are braindead how are there only 23 people left
[1:47:33] <frostywhite> its like 3rd circle
[1:47:43] <sbs956> never understood this game tbh

[1:48:11] <Izaslayer> hamzHMM boi.
[1:48:12] <mrgrevious1> @chrisppapples Just in rebuttal to faze saying Tfue was nobody before them. Timing is close but he was beginning to rise before faze, as evident by Noah‚Äôs list. Wasn‚Äôt a counterpoint to anything you said. Just another point
[1:48:20] <BuzzTTV_> @daequanhairstlye looks like its gonna be funny
[1:48:21] <frostywhite> end game customs are mad fun @KingRichard
[1:48:23] <OneThirty> @pistolmaravich I agree. But talking numbers, insta/Twitter are now much more popular than Facebook
[1:48:25] <almightygod4> Waiting for Spiderman Far From Home
[1:48:26] <bigjustin69x> land tilted and be toxic
[1:48:37] <pistolmaravich> @onethirty i don‚Äôt know about that... is that monthly users or total?
[1:48:44] <daequanhairstlye> @almightygod4 oh yeahhh
[1:48:48] <BuzzTTV_> @daequanhairstlye new chucky kinda looks doo doo tbh
[1:48:51] <RaccoonsDead> Who do you guys think will be the next villain for the avengers?
[1:49:01] <superbz2> #residentsleeper
[1:49:01] <pistolmaravich> @onethirty i could see monthly maybe but total i think FB is still killing it
[1:49:04] <squillyummmm> nickmercsHMM
[1:49:08] <OneThirty> @pistolmaravich I think it‚Äôs based on daily traffic basically

[1:49:19] <ChrisppApples> @mrgrevious1 I thought that was what you meant but wasn't sure.
[1:49:51] <RaccoonsDead> I‚Äôm torn. Galactus makes the most sense, but kang and dr doom would be great to do before Galactus
[1:49:52] <WinterH0wl> Looks like its coffee time
[1:49:54] <BuzzTTV_> @daequanhairstlye I respect it
[1:50:05] <TrailingBJ> Imagine playing Apex in May 2019 LUL

[1:50:31] <superbz2> @kingrichards chat is the best no cap
[1:50:32] <pistolmaravich> apex? apex?!? you mean the game that doesn‚Äôt see what it has in front of it???
[1:50:36] <Sevyeire> LUL
[1:50:36] <frostywhite> idk they gotta do a bunch of normal non avengers movies before galatus for doom even come close to happenin

[2:21:00] <RaccoonsDead> I like Apex way more than other BR games but the content isnt changing fast enough to keep up with fortnite
[2:21:03] <vampiric723> apex knows season 1 wasnt what it should have been thats why nothing new is coming out yet. they are putting all the work into season 2

[2:39:45] <CashRunzDaWorld> The drunk stream lastnighr had me crying
[2:40:00] <akaner888> @cashrunzdaworld I think he was afraid they eventually would take some of its or maybe he honestly just wanted out of the contract so he could have other sponsorships that the contract didn‚Äôt allow for
[2:40:05] <OneThirty> @cashrunzdaworld Shit was funny as hell
[2:40:17] <BeastykidTv> My dad is cool
[2:40:41] <TrickShot_JB> I never saw the tweet did tfue say it was 80%? Faze said all contracts are %20 and only for branding and ‚Äúfaze‚Äù mech
[2:41:07] <akaner888> Either way, I feel bad for Banks. Dude seems genuinely awesome and wholesome. He‚Äôs so hurt by all this and I can‚Äôt say I blame him
[2:41:16] <CashRunzDaWorld> @akaner888 Idk bro don‚Äôt think they would go after his twitch or YT money
[2:41:23] <OneThirty> @trickshot_jb The contract holds the facts, I‚Äôm sure court will figure it out lol
[2:41:30] <TrickShot_JB> @akaner888 Yup big feels bad for banks
[2:41:55] <CashRunzDaWorld> Yeah I mean this man got ‚Äúcode tfue‚Äù tatted on his Leg....
[2:42:01] <athan_8> he said they went after his tournament money
[2:42:03] <CashRunzDaWorld> FeelsBadMan
[2:42:05] <lwr_kings69> But tfue could have made more off of other sponsors like Jordan
[2:42:27] <fisher29norris> What up guys
[2:42:43] <TrickShot_JB> I think the issue is tfue wants out and they don‚Äôt want to release contract
[2:42:48] <CashRunzDaWorld> Man got his names on him and he betrayed this mans whole organization I‚Äôd be hurt to
[2:42:55] <OneThirty> @lwr_kings69 Assuming Jordan brand wanted a deal
[2:43:01] <akaner888> @cashrunzdaworld I don‚Äôt think so either, I think he let others influence his decisions that the contract was illegal or not good for him and he went with it so he could do other things that he thinks will be better for him
[2:43:03] <LeMighty_> hamzEZ hamzSalute
[2:44:10] <lwr_kings69> If you heard faze had certain brands they sponsor and tfue could have made more just like ninja

[2:48:03] <ughdoks> why no apex?? :(
[2:48:03] <pistolmaravich> tv inside the main building
[2:48:04] <Divine_marksmen> it does nothing
[2:48:04] <slaughtorious> The fact is Tfue signed a contract and he should be held to that as it is legally binding, no matter how sideways it was. If this is a ploy to get himself out of the contract we can all agree there are other ways to achieve that outcome without dragging FaZe through the mud.

[3:07:38] <nikktesla> You give up apex? @KingRichard
[3:07:47] <MaddKiwi> banks trying to take credit for tfues success, its just not that simple. tfue in a rare position right now

[4:46:24] <freiiizyy> Faze fanboys toxic
[4:46:38] <wargazzem> even tho faze is falling off
[4:46:40] <birdyloks1> @joehandles I was just telling him that lmao shit was funny as hell krR said Tfue has small peen
[4:46:47] <wargazzem> been fell off it was a cod clan
[4:46:48] <Mantisss> faze did help tfue get known theres no doubt about that look at the charts
[4:46:49] <SauceOnYo6> He shoulda just never signed a shit contract fr
[4:46:50] <kemkka> banks hella toxic for making faze look like they did nothing wrong
[4:46:57] <wargazzem> cod died there hanging on for life
[4:47:05] <Mantisss> tfue wouldnt b this big if he never joined faze
[4:47:08] <wargazzem> tfue and cloakzy made them relevant

[4:47:32] <vexedfish> #REALEASETHECONTRACT
[4:47:39] <CyrusoVirus> I agree somewhat KR but the stuff with drinking and him getting hurt and having it send to the dept of labor was a low blow...he came out on video saying he didn't want to do those things, but he's a grown man he can say no to a lawyer.
[4:47:41] <Junioronomy> @mantisss that‚Äôs b.s.

[4:48:36] <Izaslayer> How we know he telling the truth..? Has fae gave him permission to release the contract?

[4:48:41] <AnthonyFingers101> g

[4:48:53] <Bohners> @birdyloks1 when
[4:48:55] <tarkwoods63> 19 years old and doesnt think its smart enough to read before you sign a contract ??????

[4:49:36] <CyrusoVirus> I'm not on tfues side. I think his family is heavily influencing these decisions.
[4:49:37] <mustangggg> What are your thoughts on the game since coming from apex bro?
[4:49:41] <terrylufc1996> Why would Tfue lie theres no need to there must be something in his contract unfair
[4:49:44] <jakefrederick04> drop turrets
[4:49:48] <wargazzem> faze didnt give tfue godly hand eye coordination
[4:49:54] <Rambitoz2> #ShiwTheMTFContract
[4:49:55] <onehardtarget1> why do people lkie tfue he is a rude prick plus he says the same shit everyday on his stream oh this game is shit dude
[4:50:04] <PapaPeza> not the same
[4:50:12] <PapaPeza> not the same disagree
[4:50:13] <bigmac420chitown> no the bulls are the bulls because of mh

[4:50:17] <birdyloks1> Fuck idk when @bohners a while ago maybe season 3
[4:50:18] <tarkwoods63> but @kingrichard kingdont you think he should be smart enough at 19 to read what he signing ?????
[4:50:20] <Izaslayer> Hes raw and talented
[4:50:22] <Mantisss> tfue was forced to drink underrage while with faze truly unfortunate Kappa
[4:50:32] <zachthetank96> @CaLiKiLLiN yep rip
[4:50:33] <kemkka> they signed him to a contract that ties his hands it's pretty simple
[4:50:34] <car3ying> nah quit sleepin on pippen
[4:50:34] <dfreshiee> Your dumb
[4:50:36] <Finessed> faze put tfue on the map
[4:50:39] <Sinz1019> Bulls got put on the map by Jordon
[4:50:46] <xlildreamer> @terrylufc1996 , is there prove of TFue side showing us something .. Cuz Banks told his side already
[4:50:51] <jakefrederick04> no he was offering drinks
[4:50:52] <Sinz1019> Cavaliers got put on the map by Lebron
[4:50:54] <Ave86> @onehardtarget1 I love Tfue. reminds me of me. He dies 1000x on stream like I do every night and he's one of the best in the game.His torunament play is insane
[4:50:57] <CyrusoVirus> Maybe not, Jordan had a sick ass team which that org put together without pippen how many times did he win???
[4:50:58] <cdigzz> Tark at 19 noooooooooooo
[4:51:00] <dtynes242> Nobody can force him to do anything lol
[4:51:05] <dfreshiee> Jordan had a squad and won like 5 or 6 ships
[4:51:08] <cdigzz> Thats young
[4:51:16] <squillyp_318> Song name?
[4:51:16] <SYNTAG> To say Tfue would've blown up without Faze is a bold claim- even despite his skill. We can't deny Faze helped at least snowball his fame.
[4:51:19] <Ave86> @onehardtarget1 I like real people. Not people who fake it for streams
[4:51:25] <pistolmaravich> people dont realize the temptation that money has on you when youre 19 im 19 and if you threw a mil at me i would accept even if shit consequences LUL
[4:51:25] <terrylufc1996> @xlildreamer there legally not aloud to show us anything
[4:51:27] <SauceOnYo6> Somebody should have been paying attention
[4:51:34] <kemkka> I'm willing to bet tfue has made the same amount of money for FaZe that the WHOLE org did the previous decade in the cod communities
[4:51:36] <dfreshiee> Lmao
[4:51:37] <Causing> gotta lawyer up
[4:51:40] <wargazzem> @Finessed no no no dude tfue was dominating long before faze he had a rivalry with ninja before fortnite even got released
[4:51:48] <PoorHim> bro it doesn't matter he was starting.. as well he was growing and faze saw that in him and thought they could make money off of him... and clout
[4:51:55] <basedcho> Back in ‚Äò07, LeBron brought a pack of union warehouse workers and part time UPS drivers to the playoffs alone
[4:51:56] <cdigzz> He needs a good lawyer
[4:51:56] <ruinorjoo> It's not just reading the contract lmao, you need a contract to be reviewed by a lawyer or they slip fucked up shit in there
[4:52:05] <CyrusoVirus> So what? He signed it. He's an adult?!?!
[4:52:11] <scottykarate_> i think tfue got a lot of social media presence as well because of getting close to banks and the the other members by also partying as much as they depicted together and the stunts he would pull. Tfue most likely wouldn't have done that with any other org
[4:52:17] <zachthetank96> damn
[4:52:18] <jakefrederick04> dickless
[4:52:28] <fdomj267> Yeah it‚Äôs not like Tfue was new to all this! Lol so he should know better
[4:52:31] <cdigzz> 19 fake adult
[4:52:47] <promasterdog1> #moni moni
[4:52:50] <WafflesEVRYday> LUL
[4:52:57] <terrylufc1996> its like selling youre soul to the devil n28LUL
[4:53:03] <jakefrederick04> ur a adult at 25
[4:53:03] <methical242> preach
[4:53:03] <DRACONOR13> banks found him as a small streamer
[4:53:05] <xlildreamer> If I can pick a team .. I would pick TSM cuz Dae & Hamz
[4:53:07] <dfreshiee> Salty
[4:53:08] <PoorHim> @CyrusoVirus Faze saw potential in him and no body in the world would've thought you can or will be that big of a star lol
[4:53:13] <sloxysee> king richard is the most reasonable guy ive listened to so far
[4:53:14] <CyrusoVirus> Adults should face adult consequences. lmao
[4:53:20] <Sinz1019> You got a get out clause @kingrichard I think that's the main thing... people need a get out clause...
[4:53:25] <wargazzem> heres another analogy u draft tom brady in 6th round now hes highest paid player
[4:53:28] <Mantisss> @jakefrederick04 u can join the military at 18 thats when ur an adult
[4:53:32] <Izaslayer> Dae said one stream he'd go to faze...
[4:53:34] <WafflesEVRYday> yesh sorry bro your not an adult at 19. you think u are but get real ur not LUL
[4:53:36] <cdigzz> Its like levon bell... He deserved a new contract
[4:53:36] <birdyloks1> Why are you backing up tfue remember he dissed you
[4:53:44] <wargazzem> u cant make tom brady play for his rookie deal after superbowls
[4:53:44] <KIK1> Checkout devin Nash has got some great info on the whole Tfue / faze situation
[4:53:45] <jakefrederick04> no shit
[4:53:49] <Ave86> @CyrusoVirus You think this only happens to him?This happens all the time. If you were dead broke and someone were offering you more money then you ever had to play a game you would've signed it too buddy
[4:53:52] <Izaslayer> If I had a choice i wouldnt sign but not everyone can do that
[4:53:55] <SauceOnYo6> You gotta play out your contract even if you are better than it
[4:53:57] <dfreshiee> You think you know a lot bud
[4:54:02] <SYNTAG> They already agreed on the original contract, Faze offering a new agreement and nullifying the original was generous
[4:54:03] <KookieBreed> @CyrusoVirus defending a predatory practise, huge Kappa
[4:54:03] <sloxysee> military wouldnt be shit without me, i want my 80%

[4:54:19] <wargazzem> #releasethecontract
[4:54:19] <kemkka> anyone would sign that line as a nobody trying to make it
[4:54:28] <CyrusoVirus> Tfue is an adult. He got huge. He wants more. They've taken little to no money from him. At 18 your an adult.
[4:54:32] <pistolmaravich> id sign that and i dont even stream
[4:54:35] <Mantisss> this is all made up drama for more "clout"
[4:54:37] <justpreston> You get offered $1 mill per year for 3 years at age 19 hell yeah he signed that shit
[4:54:44] <bmeni3> #releasethecontract
[4:54:51] <terrylufc1996> He does owe FaZe money tho hes blown up and they have not taken anything off him
[4:54:51] <PoorHim> how do u know that though cyruso lol
[4:54:53] <Izaslayer> Youd get youtube money and twitch money plus free living but they would take all yo bread
[4:54:54] <kemkka> they basically trapped tfue cause of their power

[4:55:28] <Bohners> League of legends is the biggest!! get ur facts right !!! ninjaS
[4:55:28] <Izaslayer> Youd quickly see you got hoe'd
[4:55:31] <Ave86> @localtrapstar21 those numbers are good for decent people but tfue doing 50k viewers almost daily and has surpassed that amount
[4:55:31] <unknownmirage> he chose to sign it and they gave him exposure, period. just because he blew up doesnt mean they have to even renegotiate the contract but they attempted.
[4:55:32] <kemkka> anyone notice how DK is kinda neutral? I wonder if TSM did him dirty
[4:55:39] <Mantisss> @scottykarate_ said no one ever
[4:55:40] <jakefrederick04> ur mind aint fully developed till 25, wen u stop being a dumbshet like tfue
[4:55:42] <iBurleyGames> Dude that Combat Shotgun is stupid.
[4:55:42] <PoorHim> if they made 60k off of him from brand deals that means hes only made 300k from brand deals thats horrible for a person that has that kind of power
[4:55:43] <cdigzz> Bop
[4:55:51] <wi1186> did you guys talk bout what just happen with cloak? dont wanna bring it up again if ya did
[4:55:51] <chnlsvn> BibleThump
[4:55:52] <wargazzem> tfuePEEK tfuePEEK tfuePEEK
[4:55:54] <Izaslayer> i still wonder how DK got out of TSM
[4:56:01] <OneThirty> @kemkka I don‚Äôt think TSM did DK dirty.
[4:56:03] <wargazzem> tfueHIGH tfueHIGH tfueHIGH
[4:56:05] <terrylufc1996> Imagine Tfue competing in the fortnite friday on 31st for his own money Kappa
[4:56:07] <ExtraSauceGaming> theres actually Jordans in this game LUL thats a W
[4:56:09] <OneThirty> @izaslayer His contract was up
[4:56:13] <pistolmaravich> @wi1186 what happened w cloak?
[4:56:14] <xkesean> Flint over scar I love it
[4:56:15] <cdigzz> No
[4:56:15] <chrisblan710> @kemkka cus dk is friendly with turner and banks of course hes neutral
[4:56:15] <ohwoww> Yo dude, thanks for supporting tfue!
[4:56:16] <justpreston> @ave86 he wasn‚Äôt getting 50K viewers before faze bro he was avg like 100 lol
[4:56:18] <sbkillerabcd> its not that they did not take money its the fact that they could take almost 80 percent any time between 3 years
[4:56:19] <unknownmirage> cloak only came on stream to show tfues video
[4:56:19] <c_o_l_e_> @OneThirty right
[4:56:26] <scottykarate_> @Mantisss skills speak for itself.
[4:56:28] <kemkka> @onethirty why wouldn't he resign then lol
[4:56:30] <SYNTAG> The real question is- even if the contract is revealed to take 80% of Tfue's earnings- does Tfue even have a chance at winning his case against Faze?
[4:56:32] <birdyloks1> DKs contract had ran its course
[4:56:33] <ruinorjoo> If it was all FaZe that blew Tfue up, why aren't all their members that big?
[4:56:33] <pistolmaravich> dk said he left tsm bc he had more sponsorships he could get if he wasnt tied to tsms sponsors
[4:56:35] <Izaslayer> Ahh okay thanks @KingRichard @OneThirty
[4:56:35] <TXGER> is kr doing fortnite friday
[4:56:37] <wargazzem> the bottomline is there no protection for talent in esports
[4:56:42] <wargazzem> thats all about to change
[4:56:44] <wi1186> he showed tfue video than got yelled at and had to get off stream
[4:56:45] <tarkwoods63> in all honesty this lawsuit is to protect him incase he win world cup lol he knows they going to take a cut from that so he dropped the lawsuit before world cup start
[4:56:46] <Demebird> Anyone here saying you should know what you're signing at 19. Their are 30 year olds that can't read through that legal jargon.
[4:56:47] <wargazzem> its about people
[4:56:50] <SauceOnYo6> Exactly he signed for too long they shouldn‚Äôt have to let him out lol
[4:56:50] <Izaslayer> He was a fortunate one
[4:56:51] <wargazzem> yes
[4:56:52] <Ave86> @unknownmirage Yes he signed it.If they don't want to renegotiate then Tfue has every right to hire a lawyer to create an outing for him. Every contract is supposed to have a way out.
[4:56:54] <wi1186> its a stand towards contracts
[4:56:56] <WafflesEVRYday> thank you!! i said last time that short term contracts are way better. it gives u control
[4:57:03] <Demebird> *There
[4:57:05] <chnlsvn> Nobody should sign longer than a year
[4:57:11] <methical242> its about the people and making people aware of business
[4:57:21] <supeme10> hey man
[4:57:22] <unknownmirage> the main point is he read and signed a contract and they didnt even have to attempt renegotiating
[4:57:23] <wargazzem> unfiar contracts in esports are modern day slavery for tech age
[4:57:25] <Bohners> @kingrichard Who is the leader of NRG ??
[4:57:30] <wi1186> contracts are wicked if you dont know what youre getting into
[4:57:30] <birdyloks1> And Dk didn‚Äôt want to resign cause he says he is to old to be in TSM
[4:57:31] <methical242> it happens in business ALL THE TIME. read you contract, leases, etc.
[4:57:32] <shiftynissan> @kingrichard you would be the best Streamer to game and chat with. sports talk is the best!
[4:57:33] <OneThirty> @kemkka maybe he feels he doesn‚Äôt need to be apart of an org, doesn‚Äôt have to push X amount of ads per hour, so on and so on. There are probably many reasons he didn‚Äôt resign
[4:57:38] <methical242> anything that you sign - read.
[4:57:38] <SYNTAG> The real question is- even if the contract is revealed to take 80% of Tfue's earnings- does Tfue even have a chance at winning his case against Faze?
[4:57:38] <pistolmaravich> and banks is being shady saying he wants the best for tfue... if you want the best for him let him leave your org... friends and business dont mix @KingRichard
[4:57:43] <cdigzz> Its like a players union
[4:57:49] <wargazzem> they control everything they feast on kids who just want fame
[4:57:54] <blucas_atc> Love the edm vibes for background music. Just came back from EDC and it was lit! @kingrichard
[4:57:59] <wargazzem> ive been saying they need a union or something
[4:58:03] <chrisblan710> its kinda a full loop the creators need the veiwers and the veiwers basically need the orgs to tell them who to watch
[4:58:03] <kemkka> @onethirty well he said theres plenty of reasons he just didnt say them
[4:58:11] <wi1186> #releasethecontract
[4:58:17] <unknownmirage> if you cant understand a contract then dont sign it.
[4:58:23] <thekidlarry17> did the cloakzy shit just happen??
[4:58:24] <squillyummmm> Faze radiates the same energy as a fraternity

[5:00:19] <chnlsvn> even though they hadn't collected but 50grand from him
[5:00:19] <celloboy96> @kingrichard I agree to a point because it was a shit contract everyone knows that but if it is a 3 year deal you have to stay for that 3 years even if you blow up. it is the same thing where curry on golden state till 2 years ago was still on his rookie contract making about the league minimum even though 2 years ago he was one of the best
[5:00:25] <TXGER> are you playing in the friday fortnite
[5:00:26] <strangestspace> happens al the time in other industies

[5:00:31] <OneThirty> @kemkka Every business is going to try and make a contract that makes them good money.
[5:00:33] <CyrusoVirus> I agree @onethirty but they haven't tfue is worth millions. They don't want his shit.
[5:00:34] <unknownmirage> cloak jebaited all of you. he only came on stream to.share tfues response
[5:00:37] <wargazzem> u cant negptiate in bad faith
[5:00:38] <wi1186> what trick shots you kno how to do?
[5:00:43] <wargazzem> no
[5:00:56] <bigthirty> no he left 4headd
[5:00:59] <jbogs8> What about apex
[5:00:59] <birdyloks1> Depends we‚Äôre your at if you go to the 805 area it‚Äôs the best weather @bohners
[5:01:01] <nbabound_3> What‚Äôs up brother! @kingrichard
[5:01:13] <wargazzem> but the golden state warriors didnt tell him he couldnt have shoe deals
[5:01:13] <chnlsvn> I just think at the time tfue was just very naive and uneducated in what the contract entitled
[5:01:14] <WafflesEVRYday> you know ppl can get out of contracts all the time right???
[5:01:19] <jbogs8> APEX?
[5:01:19] <OneThirty> @cyrusovirus That‚Äôs what banks has said. Of courSe he would say that
[5:01:20] <bigthirty> could
[5:01:20] <wargazzem> couldnt get endorsements
[5:01:21] <glassburgh_412> Way to much legal stuff
[5:01:24] <wargazzem> thats the difference
[5:01:26] <zommbiebby> @birdyloks1 you from ventura?
[5:01:26] <glassburgh_412> Not even worth it
[5:01:29] <Madbrain99> at the end of the day its just business
[5:01:33] <shiftynissan> @kingrichard I still think you and ninja should have been partners for the world cup. you guys used to make this game look like child's play
[5:01:34] <Kindred_Black> cheer100
[5:01:40] <wargazzem> the law is pandoras box
[5:01:44] <ezio_kenway_> hey I agree with tfue 100 %
[5:01:45] <NadiaRN> he shoulda read the contract
[5:01:47] <Ave86> Curry didn't have to stay. He couldn've renegotiate or he could've left got traded etc. Curry stayed because he believed he would be compensated not because he had to stay
[5:01:47] <SYNTAG> @KingRichard even if they were- do you think Tfue even has a winning case? What's the point of an agreement if we can just nullify it?
[5:01:47] <wargazzem> pandoras box

[5:02:02] <ezio_kenway_> he was a teenager when he signed the contract
[5:02:04] <herofordays> what about the whole thing with Banks claiming that they only ever made 60000 off of him? is that figure some BS?
[5:02:06] <kemkka> faze Gonna back off hes their lebron
[5:02:08] <bigthirty> @nadiarn do you read everything b4 u sign LUL
[5:02:17] <KookieBreed> @fotballgutten005 no its your suck
[5:02:21] <NadiaRN> @bigthirty yup
[5:02:23] <methical242> Curry and Golden State obviously went and discussed their contract though.
[5:02:24] <chnlsvn> This is literally the rap game on twitch
[5:02:25] <wargazzem> banks played word games
[5:02:26] <HecDaGod> minimum wage 7.15 damn where????
[5:02:28] <methical242> its called negotiating
[5:02:30] <SauceOnYo6> It doesn‚Äôt matter how much they make if he signed the deal though look at the ncaa same idea
[5:02:30] <Ave86> @SYNTAG All agreements have ways to nullify to protect both parties. If not it would be slavery
[5:02:32] <wargazzem> he said he only collected
[5:02:34] <Izaslayer> accurate
[5:02:34] <WafflesEVRYday> where the hell is minimum wage $7? thats sad :(
[5:02:36] <pistolmaravich> it wont get to court... theyll settle
[5:02:36] <bigthirty> @nadiarn right
[5:02:38] <OneThirty> @mrkushtastic You along with all of us know almost nothing about what‚Äôs going on
[5:02:43] <Mikeeru> Tfue wasn't a teen when he signed... He's 21 now he signed last year
[5:02:44] <Westie_tv> Isnt the lawsuit about the contract being illegal in california as well not just the money?
[5:02:45] <wargazzem> tfue family is loaded guys
[5:02:46] <shiftynissan> @kingrichard what do you want to do after streaming?
[5:02:49] <BesTibi> Hey @KingRichard , hello chat^^
[5:02:52] <wi1186> let him show contract
[5:02:53] <frosty_cheerios> bro was 20
[5:02:54] <CyrusoVirus> lol disagree so much KR....I don't even know how you're comparing that? You'd get raises for taking on new responsibilities. This dude is a performer. lol
[5:02:56] <wargazzem> faze got a fight on there hands
[5:02:57] <Mikey_Yuengling> lol no @ave86
[5:02:58] <karma805> faxx
[5:03:03] <Izaslayer> minimum wage is 7 here in GA
[5:03:11] <SellinHard> It‚Äôs just gonna split tbh I can‚Äôt see turner coming back after all this
[5:03:16] <Mantisss> tfue was probably smoking too much weed when he signed the contract and didnt pay attention
[5:03:18] <birdyloks1> No but I been all up and down the central coast San Luis Obispo Santa Barbara Oxnard and Ventura it‚Äôs lit there I wanna move there when I have family some day @zommbiebby
[5:03:31] <NadiaRN> @bigthirty cant take advice from a guy that writes b4
[5:03:33] <Izaslayer> Thats why its a lot of drug trafficking in the south but thats a topic for another day
[5:03:33] <chnlsvn> cloak is pretty much birdman
[5:03:37] <jschaffer97> do u think it was a smart move for tfue to make this all public or do you think it was someone else on his team that did it?
[5:03:39] <Bohners> @kingrichard try out spellbreak sometime on stream
[5:03:41] <maxgamingph> SeemsGood
[5:03:41] <kemkka> yeah it's a Terrible look for faze
[5:03:44] <ezio_kenway_> since tfue says faze took 80% of his earnings and banks says they took just 60000 thousand dollars it means that one party must be lying
[5:03:46] <CyrusoVirus> Tfue = Darelle Revis
[5:03:49] <wargazzem> dude shield up
[5:03:49] <SYNTAG> @Ave86 Are you referring to exit strategies? Because if so- that needs to be defined in the contract too,. The only thing that court helps you with outside of contracts has illegal-non enforcable clauses
[5:03:51] <luckdog941> What would you do in his situation?
[5:03:52] <SellinHard> It looks bad on everyone
[5:03:55] <bigthirty> @nadiarn ok dont at me kid
[5:03:58] <HecDaGod> @CyrusoVirus but he went from entertaining a few hundred people to 30k on average.

[5:04:06] <unknownmirage> he lied saying he was forced
[5:04:06] <FobiddenTv> Who do you think is telling the true story about faze and tfue cause after hearing tfues side there‚Äôs a lot of proof on his side and I wanted to know your opinion
[5:04:07] <kemkka> its faze that's lying for sure lmao gotta protect the brand

[5:05:10] <bigthirty> if tfue is using legel strategy y wouldn't banks
[5:05:21] <Bohners> tfue was forced to do cocaine sadly
[5:05:21] <Ave86> Banks admitted he won't let Tfue out the contract. That's the point of contention. Not splits and money Tfue wants to be free and they won't release him. It's business
[5:05:22] <bigthirty> no cap
[5:05:27] <CyrusoVirus> @onethirty yep that's what's going to happen
[5:05:27] <xBinary001x> Faze has repeatedly said over and over they tried renegotiating at Turners request. No deals were accepted nor struck between them.
[5:05:27] <mikebesner> what sucks is that tfue chose money over friendship. what a shitty guy he is
[5:05:28] <pistolmaravich> banks isnt using a strategy... hes fucking himself by talking
[5:05:42] <bigthirty> @pistolmaravich LUL LUL LUL
[5:05:44] <wargazzem> banks is uneducated
[5:05:44] <SellinHard> This whole thing is a bad look on everyone like no one is benefiting from the whole situation
[5:05:46] <idroptoomuch> @KingRichard did you change any of your settings from default?
[5:05:48] <Idexterityyy> @ezio_kenway_ If you read the lawsuit it doesn't say that Faze took 80% of his earning it said that the contract 'allow' if Faze wanted to take his earning from twitch or youtube but Faze didn't. So, I think banks is right in that Faze didn't took his earning but if he wanted to or Faze wanted the contract allows to take 80% of his earning,
[5:05:48] <pistolmaravich> @mikebesner friend and business dont go together
[5:05:50] <kemkka> faze knows how big tfues following is. they panicked and clapped back lol
[5:05:50] <squillyummmm> That stunts and drinking stuff was 100% his lawyers putting it in there. Any fire power to win the case
[5:05:56] <wargazzem> his video he looked like a drug addioct no lie

[5:06:29] <HecDaGod> @mikebesner his brother said that they been trying to negotiate for months but faze isnt budging
[5:06:31] <OneThirty> @wargazzem Banks is more successful than probably any of us will ever be LUL

[5:06:34] <clawskidna> lmao Marshmello
[5:06:37] <CyrusoVirus> Banks gives way too much of a fuck and is being tfues friend more than anything and is emotionally bothered by the process he needs to harden up
[5:06:39] <Bohners> ninjaPog
[5:06:39] <Mantisss> this just shows how naive tfue was when he signed the contract

[5:07:35] <tarkwoods63> @cokeboy7777 thank you
[5:07:37] <jschaffer97> do u think it was a smart move for tfue to make this all public or do you think it was someone else on his team that did it?
[5:07:44] <pistolmaravich> @mikebesner also bs especially since he said theyve been in contract negotiation for months..this isnt random theres a build up to this
[5:07:45] <Izaslayer> He jus too busy reading chat rn to do it
[5:07:46] <Ave86> @cokeboy7777 As a grown as man he hired a lawyer to get what he wants. SO he did take responsibility buddy

[5:08:09] <xBinary001x> Bro, poor cloakzy I stopped by cuz his title was crazy..And he literally had the worst 10 minute stream it was weird
[5:08:09] <kemkka> tfue
[5:08:12] <Ave86> @jschaffer97 Tfue didn't make this public
[5:08:15] <Bohners> @wargazzem tf u said to me ?? ninjaPog
[5:08:18] <HecDaGod> @jschaffer97 he said they been trying to handle it off social media for about 6 months
[5:08:21] <pistolmaravich> @mikebesner also banks fucked himself on twitter by saying he literally flew to tfues house to talk to them about his contract
[5:08:28] <xBinary001x> Everyone I mean everyone spammed him the Turner hashtag..#releasethecontract
[5:08:29] <wargazzem> ima hit yall with the tfue high emote
[5:08:32] <cokeboy7777> If tfue sew faze be not going to win
[5:08:34] <birdyloks1> I‚Äôm sipping on my Michelada while my Jenny gets cold @kingrichard
[5:08:34] <Kindred_Black> you vote today?
[5:08:35] <Idexterityyy> @ezio_kenway_ The lawsuit brought by his lawyers doesn't say that. So, the article is wrong. The contract states that Faze is allow to take up to 80% of his earning but they chose not to according to banks.
[5:08:35] <Mantisss> wether they tried renegoatiating or not, he claimed he was pressured into underrage drinking which everyone knows is fucking bogus lmao
[5:08:35] <wargazzem> tfueHIGH tfueHIGH tfueHIGH tfueHIGH tfueHIGH tfueHIGH
[5:08:37] <p0isn_> @Ave86 lol his daddy convinced him, not to mention his dad is heavily involved with his business opportunities. What a MAN Kappa
[5:08:40] <Mikey_Yuengling> tfue is from Florida? that explains a lot LUL
[5:08:41] <pistolmaravich> @xBinary001x i tried to look at the vod but it was all muted bc copyright what was said?
[5:08:41] <wargazzem> wasssup
[5:08:43] <mikebesner> @HecDaGod hel no but banks said he didnt know any of this
[5:08:51] <ezio_kenway_> now since tfue is massive in exports, he thinks the contract is BS for his current status
[5:08:53] <cokeboy7777> He not going to win
[5:08:54] <wargazzem> tfue is from tampa florida
[5:08:56] <xBinary001x> the beginning was the trololololo song

[5:09:36] <wargazzem> tampa
[5:09:40] <mikebesner> @pistolmaravich i dont know it just seems banks was genuine about the situation
[5:09:47] <pistolmaravich> @wargazzem if ur from here big difference thou
[5:09:51] <wargazzem> if i said clearwater people would be lost
[5:09:53] <kemkka> hes bigger than faze even lmao
[5:09:56] <mrkushtastic> @reaper_on_fortnite straight CurseLit
[5:09:57] <SauceOnYo6> @pistolmaravich they can have negotiation but if they don‚Äôt agree then he has to go with the original contract
[5:10:03] <xBinary001x> Cloakzy got yelled at for being copystriked. Said Im getting yelled at and left.
[5:10:07] <birdyloks1> Are you gonna be playing with DK any time soon ?? @kingrichard
[5:10:08] <iBurleyGames> They argument COULD be made (and I don't agree with it) that they're the reason he's any bigger than he was originally. @KingRichard
[5:10:10] <mikebesner> tfue IS the face of Faze lets be honest
[5:10:11] <pistolmaravich> @mikebesner bro.. banks literal job is to act infront of a camera LUL
[5:10:22] <cokeboy7777> Record labels do the same thing to their artists
[5:10:22] <death_bloomz> let him worry about it.
[5:10:29] <Mantisss> @mikebesner ah, nope that would be banks
[5:10:31] <Ave86> @pistolmaravich @p0isn_ As he should be. Banks said on twitter he will not release tfue. Tfue said in that video he's asked to be released. This is the contention. Banks claims he made tfue it's best for tfue to stay on faze. Record labels do this to artist all the time
[5:10:32] <cuebun> Hes not bigger than faze stop
[5:10:32] <Bohners> kr is the face of rng
[5:10:39] <justpreston> People don‚Äôt understand they would be doing the same thing they are just quick to hate bro hop off faze for a second
[5:10:42] <frosty_cheerios> they were allowed to take the money but never did
[5:10:50] <mikebesner> @pistolmaravich we'll see how this plays out
[5:10:50] <xBinary001x> Yo Please KR don t jump from the building sup

[5:11:51] <Izaslayer> I cant wait to drop a big ass bit bomb on you...
[5:11:59] <p0isn_> FaZe tried renegotiating the contract multiple times, according to Banks. Even with stipulations where tfue would get 0% taken as long as he repped FaZe. Tfue's dad is running HIM, and it's sad to see @Ave86
[5:11:59] <wargazzem> @pistolmaravich i hate arcadia too
[5:12:09] <terrylufc1996> crazy to see cloakzy leave aswell
[5:12:10] <master7yasuo> 500-1000 Viwers just 20-25 kills
[5:12:11] <wargazzem> i miss charlotte county
[5:12:14] <Mantisss> sounds like his dad wanted him off faze......
[5:12:14] <TheRealSik> had to be the most toxic answer possible
[5:12:16] <Mikey_Yuengling> if y'all have your facts somewhat straight it sounds like tfue will be paying a hefty fine for breaking his contract and then hell be free to do his own thing
[5:12:19] <wargazzem> i miss my 1gb up and down
[5:12:25] <pistolmaravich> @wargazzem dead ass my abuela and abuelo tried taking me camping there once that place is nothing but camp grounds

[5:12:27] <Ave86> @pistolmaravich No way. Record labels tried the 360 deals. SOme artist get better deals and some want to go free and get shelved. I.E lil wayne and the carter v.
[5:12:35] <Terivent> hey :)
[5:12:39] <Izaslayer> if cloak left id support him 1000%
[5:12:45] <wargazzem> where i live i cant even stream cuz my internet is garbage in this town
[5:12:51] <birdyloks1> T Fue = Antonio Brown from the Steelers beef
[5:12:53] <HecDaGod> @p0isn_ no faze tried giving him a salary of 1 mil a year with nothing being taken
[5:12:56] <xBinary001x> I think his dad is being ovver protective but something else happened...it definitely has to be about the world cup qualifying matches with cloakzy.
[5:12:58] <Izaslayer> Like a GTA mission hied have respect00+
[5:12:58] <Kindred_Black> yo people swear its they life or their money
[5:12:59] <luckdog941> Who had the best deal for you besides nrg?
[5:13:04] <Ave86> @p0isn_ Tfue and his dad are very close. Most people don't even have their dads around at all let alone supporting them making a career out of gaming
[5:13:07] <cokeboy7777> Faze not finna let tfue leave without taking a lot of money from him
[5:13:10] <realfinessor> Faxxxxxxx
[5:13:11] <HecDaGod> @p0isn_ nothing about his other incomes
[5:13:16] <thekidlarry17> how can y'all say that banks is even telling the truth
[5:13:17] <QUEENxyZEE> @kingrichard Exactly...
[5:13:19] <quinncasey> Its all about $ 4 faze
[5:13:19] <snekcamo> snekcamo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[5:13:20] <pistolmaravich> @Ave86 yeah but normally the artists shows get bigger so there money gets bigger... no record label has a contract saying they can legally take 80% of your money LUL
[5:13:21] <ieatuforbrkfst> glad to see you playing fortnite again! youre part of the reason i got into this game! you were also my first sub
[5:13:23] <Jayy_Obsession> marshmello, turn it up!
[5:13:23] <wargazzem> @pistolmaravich they still have high speed dsl lines
[5:13:23] <master7yasuo> bro how old are u?
[5:13:24] <HecDaGod> @p0isn_ hes trying to cover that up
[5:13:24] <thekidlarry17> 2 sides to every story
[5:13:24] <xBinary001x> Turners dad has sway like everyones father or family...but the tipping point is the worldcup games.
[5:13:28] <Mantisss> who was kr with before nrg?
[5:13:29] <Bohners> next song plz
[5:13:30] <death_bloomz> that's why you let the parties involved handle it
[5:13:45] <pistolmaravich> @Mantisss NRG
[5:13:50] <bigdrew7_> @kingrichard - can you, or somebody els, explain why the contract was so bad? Banx said they only ever collected $60k (not sure if I believe that) and that doesn‚Äôt sound too bad
[5:13:50] <mikebesner> tfue trying to get out before he wins that $ in world cup
[5:13:53] <pistolmaravich> @Mantisss NV
[5:13:58] <bosim164> i dont what i should think about tfue and faze‚Ä¶.
[5:13:59] <wargazzem> no org isd a good thing
[5:14:02] <Mantisss> ty
[5:14:06] <Nightbot> Follow KR on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KingRichard
[5:14:11] <wargazzem> if u make it its best to stay out of and org
[5:14:12] <kemkka> was the money NRG was offering to pay you the big thing for ya?
[5:14:26] <xBinary001x> a social media accountant should charge a bit for having millions of interactive viewers but Turner is a joogsquad which means he brought his own social media presence
[5:14:28] <Ave86> @pistolmaravich The show money use to be safe until record labels introduced 360 deals because record sales went down due to digital downloads. I.E Lupe Fiasco and lazers.
[5:14:31] <Idexterityyy> Tfue has a good chance of winning this lawsuit because in the lawsuit brought by Tfue's lawyers it states that the Faze organization isn't even register as a legitimate organization so what the Faze brand is doing is not being regulated by the government. So, this lawsuit could change E-sports organization and contracts to players depending on the outcome of the lawsuit. This is a good thing for e-sports professionals players in the long run.
[5:14:33] <cokeboy7777> If I was a pro gamer I‚Äôll be like ninja independent
[5:14:35] <SauceOnYo6> I think it‚Äôs pretty straight forward, regardless if the contract was good or bad if he signed and no breaches actually happened he‚Äôs stuck. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs right or not
[5:14:36] <pistolmaravich> @bigdrew7_ the problem is the contract says they can legally take 80% of his money... imagine he makes 30 mil when his contract is done and they say i want 24 mil
[5:14:37] <cyriall_> @KingRichard What do you think about the new meta?
[5:14:38] <OneThirty> @wargazzem If that were the case then no one would join an org FailFish
[5:14:38] <opchase> whata blood bath
[5:14:38] <HecDaGod> the crazy thing is tfue made 500k off tourneys, faze can take 400k of that
[5:14:49] <wargazzem> orgs are a for starter
[5:14:53] <OneThirty> @cokeboy7777 Ninja is signed to an org

[5:15:44] <xBinary001x> the lan parties used to be so much more expensive
[5:15:52] <yunglaa412> 4Head
[5:15:53] <pistolmaravich> @Ave86 i see what you mean but basically this contract is fucked and tfue is in the right even if legally hes obligated ya dig
[5:15:56] <Steembo> You trying duos with that kid from last night? Or am I too late for that answer? Lol
[5:16:03] <xBinary001x> it would be hundreds of dollars in the 90s so trhe org would pay for your ticket

[5:16:30] <cokeboy7777> All the money ninja make goes straight to himself
[5:16:52] <mikebesner> i like how Ninja jumped in and threw shade that Tfue wasnt even invited to compete in Fortnite Friday and that Banks made him. stay in your lane dude
[5:16:57] <xBinary001x> counterstrike lan parties were like 300 bux foor a weekend
[5:16:58] <Ave86> @pistolmaravich Tfue was broke when he signed it. Anybody would've for a chance to play games. Now that he's older and knows more he can see how unfair it is.
[5:17:06] <pistolmaravich> @Ave86 agreed
[5:17:19] <pistolmaravich> @Ave86 that money gets anyone whos broke or middle class even to say yes
[5:17:25] <kemkka> what a stupid opinion by ninja then lmao
[5:17:28] <bosim164> ninja and dk are doing it right
[5:17:38] <N0tNukes> @KingRichard I respect you so much after watching your vid talking about org contracts

[5:17:51] <Ave86> @pistolmaravich I had music offers but I was in a group and when I saw how they paid people I declined it. damn that
[5:17:56] <bwa34> Yo

[5:21:08] <bigdrew7_> Even if they did take 80% tfue still making more in a year than most people will make in a lifetime. He only blew up after he signed to faze, if he didn‚Äôt, who knows how long he would have been able to support himself on it before he had to move to a ‚Äònormal‚Äô working life
[5:21:14] <birdyloks1> There is a lot of running in season 9 @kingrichard
[5:21:17] <xBinary001x> oh pistolmara didnt know that

[5:21:42] <pistolmaravich> @bigdrew7_ if the number came out tfue made 10 mil and faze got 8 mil thats still not fair at all..

[5:23:22] <bigdrew7_> @pistolmaravich I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs fair. But the kid signed a contract. Be grateful for the opportunity, be happy making more in a year than people make in a lifetime, then move on to a new contract and make your 10s of millions on your new contract at 22
[5:23:24] <DABnONuCAT> @bigdrew7_ so tfue just carries faze 24/7 and gets robbed from his money but it‚Äôs ok with u cuz other people in the world don‚Äôt have the opportunity like him but he showed out and deserved it ? Bruh smh

[5:27:27] <Dark_Humor> banks made it seem like he was forcing tfue to stay in faze isn't he supposed to be his friend
[5:27:41] <Coffey_Gaming_> If tfue cant get out of his contract can faze take 80% of world cup earnings and all other earnings until his contract is up? If so its a risky move by turner
[5:27:42] <CurrieNoCurry> Apex would do better if they had weekly updates like fortnite with no legends or whatever

[5:35:11] <Bohners> Release my birth certificate contract SATAN
[5:35:14] <JT_THE_AMAZiNG> Contract has illegal terms under California law. Bad contract is bad end of story Lol not that hard.
[5:35:23] <vcruzmac> i could bet that contract isnt as unfair as Tfue is claiming, he just want to buy his exit because he know he could make more money
[5:35:25] <Wickedkitten> iPad
[5:35:29] <OPI_Gucci> @globalxchris pc
[5:35:35] <petemanouse> He had his own YouTube channel before faze... don‚Äôt tel me he wasn‚Äôt big lol
[5:35:46] <jakefrederick04> they added a feature where when u leave ur body is there for 60 secs
[5:35:46] <supremeghostie> LUL his head
[5:35:59] <marnermaybe> i have my own youtube channel, wtf are you talking about that doesnt mean anything lol
[5:36:00] <SentinelEagle> Wait i thought this was arenas?
[5:36:05] <gloman88> You‚Äôre allowed to opt out of a contract. They prob told him no that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs taking legal action
[5:36:06] <Bohners> kr show ur dog on stream
[5:36:06] <OneThirty> @petemanouse Anyone can have a YouTube channel LUL
[5:36:20] <xjackxlesliex> @kingrichard do you watch Game Of Thrones and if so did you watch it all?

[5:36:39] <wogboy7> Hey KR
[5:36:45] <petemanouse> @onethirty Ik that but he actually had a lot of followers on his YouTube channel before he got in faze bc he did crazy stunts and smoked a lot
[5:36:57] <Wickedkitten> Tfue would have blown up regardless because he‚Äôs that good a player
[5:36:57] <bigthirty> tfues dad crazy but not retarded
[5:37:06] <jakefrederick04> shut up glo now im hungry
[5:37:09] <petemanouse> Trust me his YouTube channel was already big before he was in faze
[5:37:20] <spobowz> true is just bad ninja is even way better than him as a player lol
[5:37:21] <pistolmaravich> @kingrichard apparently tfues contract doesn‚Äôt pay anything from what banks has said
[5:37:21] <marnermaybe> @petemanouse talking straight out of his ass lol
[5:37:22] <Blunt_Box> yeah thats big facts and i believe it
[5:37:31] <gemmy1984> LULZ
[5:37:36] <Izaslayer> you have to be popping to join an org people
[5:37:39] <petemanouse> @marnermaybe definitely not lol
[5:37:48] <SentinelEagle> @petemanouse no it wasnt... the graphs of his growth have been released, he was tiny, then joined FaZe and skyrocketed
[5:37:49] <nikzumwalt123> people who say ninja is better is brown nosing
[5:37:50] <Blunt_Box> LOLOL yeah ninja has won alot of prize money @spobowz WutFace
[5:37:53] <OneThirty> @izaslayer Not true
[5:37:59] <petemanouse> @marnermaybe I watched his videos on YouTube before fortnite even came out
[5:38:01] <cherrypoppin> he was offered salary but never took it
[5:38:02] <Wickedkitten> Banks said they didn‚Äôt take his prize money, he didn‚Äôt say anything about the rest of it
[5:38:09] <bigthirty> he makes nothing and apparently they can take 49%
[5:38:18] <pistolmaravich> @kingrichard banks said that they‚Äôve offered tfue salary and tfue didn‚Äôt accept it
[5:38:22] <MylesJ_> The original contract is wack but they offered him 1million a year with no percentage of what he makes.. Tfue dad just doesnt want him on Faze
[5:38:23] <SentinelEagle> @petemanouse that doesnt mean he was huge...
[5:38:28] <SentinelEagle> that means he had one viewer lol
[5:38:29] <poggers_1> Watch banks video and he is releasing the full contract later
[5:38:42] <cherrypoppin> @Wickedkitten watch banks video he states they didn't take anything besides 20% from two brand deals
[5:38:52] <xjackxlesliex> We are never gonna see that contract
[5:38:54] <pistolmaravich> @mylesj_ even 1 mil a year isn‚Äôt enough for tfue... he goes solo he makes more then that off sponsorships. think about it ninja made 1 mil for streaming apex for 1 day
[5:38:57] <OneThirty> @pistolmaravich But that salary prolly came with another 1,2,3 more years though.
[5:38:58] <CurrieNoCurry> Whatever happened to dizzy from apex ??
[5:38:59] <jakefrederick04> weve been talking about faze contracts for an hour
[5:39:00] <Hexagon128> play arena instead of this casual mode

[5:39:14] <summerlemonade> sawlury
[5:39:22] <Wickedkitten> @cherrypoppin did you not notice how edited it was?
[5:39:22] <vcruzmac> @kingrichard i understand your point, but, i mean, imagine you are Tfue in early 2018, and you are about to join Faze but the contract says they could take 80 percent of your earnings; i don't want to be disrespectful, but, how stupid do you have to be to sign a contract like that?
[5:39:24] <KushIsMyCologne> people underestimate how much tfue brings in LUL
[5:39:25] <spobowz> watched tfue before he is not as good as most pro players by far he just got lucky
[5:39:26] <bigthirty> its 1 word against the next so it's up to court now
[5:39:32] <sanetila> tac epic
[5:39:34] <summerlemonade> its sawlury @KingRichard
[5:40:03] <SUPERSLiiME> A lot of people I feel that speak on it are kids who don‚Äôt understand the money and how contracts work

[5:40:12] <Blunt_Box> not stupid at all if youre trying to make it just like he did? WutFace @vcruzmac
[5:40:12] <gloman88> Actors and athletes make their majority of money off of endorsements guys. Salary ain‚Äôt shit
[5:40:25] <KushIsMyCologne> I feel like people never look at contracts and act like they know what they are talking about LUL

[5:41:03] <JT_THE_AMAZiNG> Lol Idk what yall don't get about his contract being illegal under California Law smh. There's no way Faze can win that's why they offered restructured contracts
[5:41:03] <2wiezy> LMFAO
[5:41:04] <EA_servers_sux> What kind of message does this send to the youth though? They can get out of contracts if they threaten to sue?

[5:41:07] <petemanouse> Tfue being really good at fortnite helped him get big because he already had a YouTube channel and was able to get himself out there to the public easier
[5:41:09] <killercoleyyy> !wins
[5:41:09] <Nightbot> 4 wins (17k, 12k, 12k, 16k)

[5:41:46] <methodicalmantis> Tfue qualified solo for the World Cup.. That aint luck. WTF is wrong with some people?

[5:41:52] <TheLooseSkrew> @shybaer BibleThump
[5:41:54] <brandon_ellis21> FaZe got him into fortnite Friday. TFue did the rest by himself
[5:41:57] <petemanouse> @sentineleagle faze wouldn‚Äôt of heard of him if he didn‚Äôt put this clips up on his own YouTube channel

[5:43:40] <jakefrederick04> dream came tru kr
[5:43:41] <pistolmaravich> i was thinking if tfue joined 100t he could make his name 100Tfue and i thought that was cool Kappa
[5:43:43] <QUEENxyZEE> @mjutsu Awwww, Okay. Sorry. kingrichLove
[5:43:44] <petemanouse> @marnermaybe it‚Äôs definitely not lol but you can assume what you want
[5:44:03] <NJK_Graal> Richard, you planning to qualify for any category of the World Cup?

[5:44:06] <marnermaybe> @petemanouse you can literally google it.. genius.

[5:44:22] <shiftynissan> gaming in any aspect of the industry is my dream too!!
[5:44:22] <Kirgrm> my dream was becomming a alternative farmer, didnt make it yet, now diagnosed with serious sickness :'(
[5:44:22] <MylesJ_> its too watered down to grow now, only way you making it is by being super entertaining or highly skilled
[5:44:35] <xBinary001x> you know whats scary..some of the best gamers are not even pros...i knew this one kid in college. he was a monster at first person shooters
[5:44:39] <ZigZack> The Timmy Turner homework paid off

[5:44:54] <methodicalmantis> The entire business model of FaZe centers around clout and influencing public opinion. They trade in commodities that you can't even touch. I don't doubt for a second that it's money first PERIOD with them.
[5:44:56] <omgplague> tfue is prop the best fort player in the world he didnt get into faze for no reason. wait till world cup

[5:45:21] <pistolmaravich> @kingrichard if you can even speak on it just be honest was your contract from faze some BS in it too?
[5:45:27] <heythatsfabio> If it was all love banks would‚Äôve released Tfue from faze
[5:45:28] <bigthirty> sometimes you gotta take setbacks to get a comeback
[5:45:29] <righteouslockz> Tfue will be just fine. Have his own brand millions of dollars etc
[5:45:36] <xjackxlesliex> Tfue isn‚Äôt big enough nor does he have the money to start his own org
[5:45:36] <SeansDualBlade> its called being in the moment

[5:45:56] <nikzumwalt123> faze made a comment saying the contract may state that they are able to take 80% of Tfues earnings, but never took more than 20% @KingRichard
[5:46:03] <LitttleGRiZZ> @KingRichard do you think heavy snipe is too OP? I feel like it shouldn't be able to one shot any build plus do 150+ dmg to body..

[5:46:51] <kemkka> these kids have no clue the money on twitch
[5:46:53] <pistolmaravich> nade shot made an org and he isn‚Äôt nearly as big or has as much money as tfue

[5:48:20] <pistolmaravich> @onethirty drake and the cleveland cavs owner... the money from these orgs don‚Äôt come from the owners they come from sponsors people don‚Äôt realize that
[5:48:21] <shiftynissan> @kingrichard what kind of contract could tfue sign with NRG? hypothetically
[5:48:25] <Metaellihead> @kemkka yeah, just make sure you get the mortgage insurance taken off after 5 years

[5:49:30] <Wickedkitten> @righteouslockz it‚Äôs like how loads of people were watching ceez before he signed up with luminosity. They didn‚Äôt make him, he made himself
[5:49:32] <hagirules> Yo
[5:49:36] <Metaellihead> I remember when KR announced signing with NV and then Epic fucked the pooch on doing competitive.
[5:49:38] <kemkka> @kovhax the wild player?!

[5:56:09] <xBinary001x> this creator code business is getting out of hand
[5:56:10] <lordwizx> @gloman88 I mean I ly on console but when I tried on pc players was shooting so damn fast and editing so insane it feel like they were cheating all Im saying is its way less try hard on console thats all

[5:56:37] <spobowz> @gyrostatics just a kid who wont win any more tournaments for fortnite in his life
[5:56:38] <righteouslockz> @finlay_hague I don‚Äôt think he qualified duos maybe solo
[5:56:42] <vn9fe> BrokeBack
[5:56:46] <lionelhollywood> tfue is a young lord ceezLordus
[5:56:46] <OneThirty> @lordwizx I completely disagree but that‚Äôs just my opinion
[5:56:47] <unshaved> #releasethecontract lul
[5:56:47] <methodicalmantis> @Bohners I don't know either. But I see it as a positive for players to support each other. Just my opinion. Not hating on you or anything.
[5:57:18] <finlay_hague> @righteouslockz ok can you explain the qualifying process I swear they‚Äôve been qualifying for like 1 month now
[5:57:19] <lordwizx> @OneThirty really? your the first to say that that I know of
[5:57:28] <gyrostatics> @spobowz oh :o
[5:57:28] <unshaved> anything wrong with the sound or is it just me?
[5:57:43] <Bohners> @methodicalmantis Yeah i understand. I figured with a promotion from ninja he would expect some time of money in return lol
[5:57:45] <woollynate> just you
[5:57:46] <ItsRappidzz> what arena is @KingRichard in?
[5:57:51] <gloman88> That church music
[5:57:55] <squillyummmm> The fact that you can fly around in ballers in the slip stream is ridiculous lmao
[5:58:03] <OneThirty> @lordwizx There are really good players on every platform
[5:58:08] <xBinary001x> drop him a fifty
[5:58:14] <jamesyh555> @itsrappidzz he‚Äôs just doing the solos but he‚Äôs in champs
[5:58:29] <KaioGG> @OneThirty he's talking about overall
[5:58:30] <jamesyh555> *regular solos I mean
[5:58:37] <kemkka> @squillyummmm theres always 2-3 unmanned balls flying in those things now LUL
[5:58:45] <righteouslockz> @finlay_hague it changed so much but I do know you can compete each week for money.. but the more points you have that will determine the rank you will que in. When it comes to qualifying I think it‚Äôs about points in that division
[5:58:49] <ItsRappidzz> ok @jamesyh555
[5:58:50] <vn9fe> He s mad
[5:59:00] <IceTrayTheGang> I want that skin just cuz it has fire kicks

[5:59:34] <MLGNatsu> Epic Games needs to vault one of the snipers, what are your thoughts on that? @KingRichard
[5:59:34] <spobowz> i would put money on tfue never winning another fortnite tournament in his life
[5:59:38] <vn9fe> BibleThump
[5:59:39] <xjackxlesliex> Signing to an organization is a lot like a player signing to a shoe company or a team they give you a small contract as a rookie and if you prove that you‚Äôre worth more you‚Äôll be payed more it‚Äôs simple so ya faze had its right sign him for low when they first signed him but now after a year of him being the best in the game they could give him an extension to the contract to keep him or he could go to another organization like free agency in any other sport
[5:59:40] <Sevyeire> unce unce unce tamsinGASM
[5:59:44] <lordwizx> @OneThirty that is completely true I just feel its not as much super hardcore players on console then pc .. like on pc players dont screw around at all like they breath and eat fortnite
[5:59:59] <jamesyh555> @kingrichard they removed vehicles for the last 2 weeks when you didn‚Äôt play and gg is weekend they‚Äôre bringing them back for qualifiers lol

[6:01:06] <lordwizx> @kemkka ahh ok

[6:01:27] <woollynate> apex sucks
[6:01:29] <methodicalmantis> @lordwizx Bro, there are NO pro controller players playing on actual consoles anymore. Noone at the top of the game isn't on PC anymore.
[6:01:35] <kemkka> KR getting them builds back
[6:01:40] <TPFOTY> How‚Äôd he take ur wall so easy
[6:01:50] <lordwizx> @kemkka lol I feel u bro hahaha
[6:02:01] <finlay_hague> @kemkka init before I left fortnite for like 3 months I was so good winning 1 game in like 3 but now I‚Äôve come back it‚Äôs so ducking hard
[6:02:04] <MLGNatsu> people use macros to take walls now which is illegal but somehow not fixed
[6:02:08] <righteouslockz> @lordwizx there‚Äôs a lot of good control players I have some on my friends list. You would think they were on pc the way they move but being a pc player is actually a lot more complicated. Especially when it comes to keybinds and sensitivity
[6:02:10] <busta_bean> Of accuracy is wild
[6:02:15] <ArshiaCraft> @kingrichard Can U gift the new skins? imean the package??
[6:02:16] <busta_bean> Pc*
[6:02:26] <bane6662> Better ping and a tehnique its not macro
[6:02:28] <pistolmaravich> @mlgnatsu bc its impossible to ban... some people actually have the timing down
[6:02:40] <lordwizx> @methodicalmantis ah makes sense
[6:02:48] <StevenJr18> I'm a good console player lool

[6:03:35] <Sevyeire> Teamers DansGame
[6:03:45] <MLGNatsu> also another bug still in the game, tactical assault rifle can still shoot through walls and you take damage.. world cup coming and not even fixed yo
[6:03:46] <Bohners> i got to champs div in 2 days....from placement alone....LOL

[7:19:06] <farrelldagod1> this is like season 4 double pump
[7:19:09] <trixbeat> old pump basically was a sniper anyway
[7:19:09] <Smokey_Savage21> I rather have one shots than shoot fast
[7:19:12] <TheLooseSkrew> @natanelelik that would be dope
[7:19:12] <HHTiemo> iits like a mix of doublepump and heavypump LUL
[7:19:18] <Glapunt> up close double pump was crazy broken though
[7:19:23] <Vexus13> imagine duel shotguns. (Not Double Pump)
[7:19:41] <vamazzed> that one viewer in the game is waiting to stream snipe next game :D

[7:20:59] <Glapunt> @natanelelik hitting 200 shots is harder than hitting 2. Don't act like drum gun dmg is broken anymore mate. smg is on the same level. only thing broken about drum is that it spams your builds.

[8:45:08] <robloxisthebestshooter> @NicoritY Most of the players from eso have moved to bdo, simply because the game is broken and its ran by idiots, although I'm addicted to eso and have played since launch.
[8:45:14] <Camvela> black desert lopoks good but i can get into a pay to win game
[8:45:14] <Xxdarktacito6xx> Vigor and rally have you thought of those for your heals?
[8:45:19] <Camvela> look*
[8:45:27] <killahsin_ce> ffix and wow if u like the tab targeting click style gameplay, this if your more into action combat. black desert if you dont mind blowing up gear for a year straight
[8:45:36] <robloxisthebestshooter> most of my friends have too, because it actually involves skill @NicoritY
[8:45:36] <BoogieWihMe> How2get this game??
[8:45:39] <Rootzlolz> @Camvela FeelsBadMan
[8:45:40] <NicoritY> @robloxisthebestshooter but Black Desert Online is pretty much P2w which stops me from playing it
[8:45:44] <TheLooseSkrew> @tamzidfarhanmogno no. but a new expansion for this just came out i think

[8:46:17] <SuperCyan8> BDO has desynch problems though
[8:46:20] <kennyboi1996> This game is amazing
[8:46:23] <Camvela> my typing is so bad i need sleep lol
[8:46:25] <robloxisthebestshooter> @NicoritY this is p2w too lol, you got warden and necro which you needa pay for both of the best classes.
[8:46:33] <TamzidFarhanMogno> thanks. Never seen it before. Heard the name before though.
[8:46:40] <ArvenAldmeri> Hey Richard. Seeing u back at eso to try the necro. I think it would be better to grind in some public dungeon like in Morrowind (thats where alcast grinds), Forgotten waste its called.
[8:46:48] <BoogieWihMe> Is the game still beta? I want answer guys :(

[8:47:04] <killahsin_ce> expansion packs are pay to win now? seriously? people really stretch criticism
[8:47:05] <RoyParkers> Nah the base game comes with warden now and they not the best class lol
[8:47:06] <NicoritY> @robloxisthebestshooter but thats only classes right? i heard in BDO the amount of money you need on a regular bases is insane
[8:47:09] <kennyboi1996> im more of a cod player but im always down to try out other games i like diablo 3 reaper of souls
[8:47:12] <Stormadonn> @boogiewihme it's been out for 5 years
[8:47:16] <Camvela> king do you have a discord?
[8:47:16] <Lalikus> @BoogieWihMe Beta? It's been out for half a decade now lol
[8:47:20] <TheLooseSkrew> @boogiewihme no
[8:47:22] <Messin> @BoogieWihMe The game has been out for almost 5 years..
[8:47:24] <iibirchii> currently streaming atm. not the best since its my first stream but im trying! Watching successful streamers like you is very inspiring!
[8:47:24] <Rootzlolz> @BoogieWihMe this game is 5 years old LUL
[8:47:43] <LOKIvsHELA> g
[8:47:56] <BoogieWihMe> I thought this was a new series connecting lol
[8:48:00] <killahsin_ce> the new changes to dk are pretty interesting
[8:48:07] <RoyParkers> The just buffed the crap outta dragon knight with this patch lol
[8:48:09] <Messin> Magicka templar will always be the best class
[8:48:15] <Rootzlolz> @BoogieWihMe oh you mean something like TES 6 ?
[8:48:30] <killahsin_ce> and the nb changes are pretty good for sustain
[8:48:33] <BoogieWihMe> Yea somethin like that
[8:48:36] <Stormadonn> @boogiewihme it's going around because there's a big content chapter release
[8:48:44] <RoyParkers> I think it‚Äôs a decent balance atm if u nice you‚Äôll pop off
[8:48:51] <NicoritY> the game seems to be interessting! but I dont know if it beats gw2 for me
[8:48:54] <Camvela> best class in an mmo doesnt even matter only that you play with whatever class gives you the most fun unless you world tier lvl and compete
[8:49:00] <killahsin_ce> yup roy
[8:49:01] <ChiGoBreed> Haha I thought you gave up on ESO... so you back for a while

[8:49:47] <NicoritY> Is there something like raiding in this game?
[8:49:54] <robloxisthebestshooter> @NicoritY I've finished everything on this game literally, I've tried bdo and the hud makes me want to puke and its definitely not the game for me I just believe that skill wise, bdo requires more of a grind and you actually gotta invest time into
[8:50:08] <robloxisthebestshooter> to get good
[8:50:08] <RoyParkers> Ya it‚Äôs got 12 man raids
[8:50:24] <UppsWarrior11> !uptime
[8:50:24] <Nightbot> 8 hours 50 minutes 40 seconds
[8:50:32] <Lalikus> @KingRichard Why not put bone colossus? It will be easier to tank and do dmg at the same time
