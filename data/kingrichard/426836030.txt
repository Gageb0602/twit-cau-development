[0:56:13] <broken8922> Right on
[0:56:23] <jake_the_nice_n_lord> low ground i guess you need a fast firing weapon. if you are a beginner. cause you need to have skill when using a shotgun @JaeB_so_nasty
[0:56:47] <steezybadass47> @nyquanyewest it’s been like 4 years since TST and he has like 1 feature
[0:56:52] <jake_the_nice_n_lord> since shotgun's are slower at firing and reloading
[0:57:06] <steezybadass47> @nyquanyewest Injury reserve the truth

[1:04:01] <jake_the_nice_n_lord> yeah fortnite is in a mode that is impossible to change because the fortnite makers are milking their players for all the money they got

[2:40:59] <Bohners> @michaeldavidson23 apex died
[2:41:01] <CharlieTHAGREAT> i just think its because they didnt think the dame will do as well as it did.
[2:41:13] <CharlieTHAGREAT> i still like it over fortnite.
[2:41:15] <pistolmaravich> i love the new AR
[2:41:16] <Quiz44> apex is dead?
[2:41:20] <dtynes242> apex was so fresh now its annoying to play
[2:41:23] <revolvertjm> there are way too many snipers in the game rn. I really think it could be more competitive if they made them lootable like the rpgs
[2:41:27] <pistolmaravich> new ar rewards good aim which is awesome
[2:41:34] <drextree> i played 1 game of apex and won never played again

[2:58:05] <revolvertjm> oddly divot and loot lake are lit... idk why.
[2:58:07] <DrThoughts> This game is 100% about aggression.
[2:58:09] <Bohners> i usually do 2 guns and rest are shields
[2:58:11] <MaddKiwi> Yes
[2:58:11] <pistolmaravich> @kingrichard it’s better to land safe so you can get extra mats and shield and then go for kills... either way you’ll end up w 10-20 kills easily
[2:58:13] <kreator6> yes
[2:58:13] <trixbeat> yes
[2:58:13] <revolvertjm> yes
[2:58:14] <Trap97765> continental building at tilted is a no gun building
[2:58:14] <Metaellihead> yes
[2:58:16] <not_dasa> yes

[2:58:34] <NoReggieZay> Dusty been a lowkey loot spot
[2:58:36] <thatboiiadrien> yes
[2:58:39] <not_dasa> you the best brother
[2:58:43] <killaacam88> lots of shield in this game mode
[2:58:46] <xosupersaiyanox> continetal building is a safe house rich you cant shoot or pick axe
[2:58:50] <killaacam88> yes
[2:58:56] <Metaellihead> It's usually best to farm up and get utils early game, then go after the #1 team cause you'll get big points for wiping a team
[2:58:57] <kreator6> you can win this with 1 kill if you want... just kill the number 1 team in the end :D

[4:34:19] <wi7vess> HEY RICHARD WHAT MADE YOU START PLAYING FORTNITE AGAIN?
[4:34:32] <electric_gynecologist> @blankytl sypher has higher views now than qualifiers today
[4:34:32] <grazedgg> BO4 tournaments rack in about 70k viewers when the game never even gets 5k daily
[4:34:35] <pistolmaravich> @blankytl i do agree people love watching tournaments but do u want to watch tfue play only scrims and get 4 kills every game or watch him drop 10 20 bombs
[4:34:43] <OmgKoda> back on fortnite weird
[4:34:50] <blankytl> @pistolmaravich There’s defiantly I chance to get out there more if your competing look at ninja even he’s competing if he’s competing then it has to be profitable
[4:34:51] <m7tbnx> @MezeTV i'm not an expert in this but i know you can buy noise cancelling equipment. go to symfuhny's stream and look under his equipment; it's right there

[4:35:46] <pistolmaravich> @blankytl this tournament is very profitable because if you win you get 3 mil lol which is why richard is saying he’s going to do the quals and stuff but not dedicate his whole stream to scrims
[4:35:50] <wi7vess> THAT PING THO
[4:35:53] <WafflesEVRYday> @KingRichard are you rockin one of the new RTX cards ?

[4:36:33] <bigmac420chitown> @queenxyzee how are u doing
[4:36:36] <Soul_series_fan> Least***
[4:36:40] <blankytl> @pistolmaravich What’s the point if you don’t put in the time you aren’t going to win. Guys are putting in more time then him ya know
[4:36:48] <grazedgg> @blankytl ninja doesnt stream himself sceimming tho
[4:36:53] <Cyantists> It’s a short combat ar so basically smg
[4:37:04] <QUEENxyZEE> @bigmac420chitown I’m doing pretty good. How are you?
[4:37:09] <pistolmaravich> @grazedgg ninja doesn’t scrim at all lol only plays arena
[4:37:21] <blankytl> @grazedgg He plays Arena with reverse a lot that’s basically scrims for him
[4:37:29] <bigmac420chitown> @queenxyzee good getting over being sick but that's ok just want to get rid of this cough I have
[4:37:33] <pistolmaravich> @blankytl arena is no where near scrims
[4:37:34] <Booticheekz> arena is pretty close to scrims depending at 2k points id think

[4:38:04] <blankytl> @pistolmaravich Champs league is pretty competitive bro you know that’s true
[4:38:16] <JustBasicGirlGamer> Hello Mr. Richards
[4:38:20] <pistolmaravich> @blankytl it was competitive now it’s a TON easier
[4:38:28] <Booticheekz> i agree but who scrims anymore other than pros? everyone is playing arena or in pro customs
[4:38:43] <hollyisthicc> gold scar
[4:38:45] <hollyisthicc> way better
[4:38:49] <toffitee1> yes
[4:38:50] <QUEENxyZEE> @bigmac420chitown I feel myself getting sick. I hope not tho. I hope you start feeling a lot better & get rid of that cough soon.

[4:38:59] <blankytl> @pistolmaravich Let’s face it if KR was competing at a high level he’d be better off right now
[4:39:00] <wi7vess> I honestly dont care about the royals this game gets me pumped sometimes for certain situations lol
[4:39:00] <yeahmagnets9016> @Booticheekz i would call a pro custom a scrim for sure
[4:39:01] <irrelevant_ow> Cx
[4:39:02] <pistolmaravich> @booticheekz that’s what i’m saying thou ninja doesn’t do pro customs ever which is the best practice bc arena now is just a competitive pub
[4:39:03] <onlyth3strongsurviv3> i would say yes
[4:39:09] <visioned_> No
[4:39:10] <bigmac420chitown> @queenxyzee yea me too
[4:39:19] <jrossthevegan> Fuck the cowboys go birds

[4:39:30] <visioned_> Drop gun 50/50
[4:39:31] <Booticheekz> yeah true pro customs r nutty. but i think arenas still get u in that scrim mindset nonetheless
[4:39:31] <oogre> things you never said in season 2... should I take the scar
[4:39:32] <bigmac420chitown> @pistolmaravich probably y ninja still hasn't qualified at all

[4:42:43] <pistolmaravich> @blankytl it’s not a talent thing pretty much is all i’m getting at but a lot of people are losing out on money from competing.. think about cloak dude hardly streams and just wins tournaments... if he streamed consistently he’d had made WAY more money

[4:43:02] <Kyfoster17> What do you get more viewership on apex or fortnite
[4:43:05] <bigbluenation721> Thoughts on Rage 2?
[4:43:10] <dnabest> by Ashland
[4:43:12] <grazedgg> EA put super low caps on how much money outside orgs could host tournaments for
[4:43:18] <blankytl> @pistolmaravich Ya but being good competing is a way to build an audience faster
[4:43:19] <xslurz> what's your favorite pickaxe @kingrichard
[4:43:26] <AlexNice> Okay so both, I'm pretty much doing the same atm, I love Apex but the lack of content is really hurting
[4:43:27] <grazedgg> so that killed the early tournament scene lol
[4:43:33] <visioned_> @dnabest Damn bro im bye state
[4:43:39] <visioned_> By*
[4:43:42] <djschaubs> Did tfue and cloak qualify??? #
[4:43:44] <pistolmaravich> @blankytl i would agree if you’re unknown.. if you’re unknown start winning some games in a pro cord something along those lines they take notice
[4:43:45] <blankytl> @pistolmaravich And it only makes sense to do it in the most popular game. To give you more of a chance to grow your audience
[4:43:55] <bigmac420chitown> well ninja qualified for tomorrow Tim didn't and idk about Lupo

[5:59:09] <Metaellihead> There are so many mobility mechanics in this game it makes running big thing
[5:59:17] <Freeza_2G> too much mobility i miss season 2 BibleThump
[5:59:24] <OHH2jz> Man this game on pc is way better than on console

[6:57:50] <danny_odb> shadow gang
[6:57:51] <NineInchNickk> @pistolmaravich banning people for having a different opinion?
[6:57:58] <ItchyNutz> Apex stop paying them

[7:02:26] <not_dasa> yeah me to
[7:02:27] <redantithesis> ?????????????????????
[7:02:27] <cal_goulden64> I agree, infinity war was better
[7:02:31] <kthoughts> blues clues was heat
[7:02:32] <xtsoulja> `same
[7:02:33] <lightzout_b> it was really touchy feely. straight for the heart
[7:02:34] <BuckleysGhost> literally don't see any superhero movies
[7:02:35] <natanelelik> @Lapp_ you got no childhood then FailFish
[7:02:39] <not_dasa> i expect more from endgame
[7:02:41] <lightzout_b> infinity war was their masterpeice
[7:02:42] <JustSoLoPa> Endgames wasn’t that good. A 3 hour recap basically.
[7:02:44] <lightzout_b> piece*
[7:02:45] <NineInchNickk> endgame was amazing, infinity wars was amazing
[7:02:48] <HaymitchPlays> I honestly still don't understand what all this hype is about grown men in costumes lol. Idk it just doesn't really excite me.
[7:02:50] <thedude1169> Bro what.. it was a joke bc obviously everyone has seen it 😂😂
[7:02:52] <grazedgg> It was good, but not "watch a 2nd time" good
[7:02:54] <WafflesEVRYday> it was good bcuz it gave a resolution to the conflict. but i agree its not my top 3 mcu movies
[7:02:56] <xtsoulja> ed edd and eddie the one though
[7:02:57] <jusplashh> It was over hyped
[7:03:00] <matt99876> I haven’t seen it
[7:03:13] <BeSharper> Is Apex Legends dead?
[7:03:18] <pistolmaravich> spongebob movie>avengers
[7:03:22] <IceCreamPosse> It was slow af
[7:03:23] <NineInchNickk> it fulfilled all expectations, it was a perfect end to the story, honestly couldnt have asked for better
[7:03:27] <grazedgg> ^
[7:03:28] <Nightbot> ^^
[7:03:30] <dominick07m> can i play with you on fortnite

[7:03:31] <IceCreamPosse> First 2 hours snoozefest
[7:03:33] <sheperd897xyx> i will just watch when i can buy it
[7:03:34] <JewLifePS4> Apex not completely dead but it’s on life support due to lack of content
[7:03:38] <Kaorrosi> They tried to trick us into thinking it was good by showing our favorite scenes from other movies
[7:03:39] <Anexum> apex isnt dead, its dying tho unfortunately
[7:03:40] <HaymitchPlays> Can someone explain to me what is so cool about the marvel universe? cuz i don't seem to get it. To me its all like cringy and boring. Does that mean i have no soul and am doomed?
[7:03:40] <OnSched4GoodMeas> why fn
[7:03:43] <WafflesEVRYday> out of all the mcu movies, name the 3 worst ones @KingRichard

[7:03:57] <Speak_OfThe_Devil> The end battle scene and cap wielding mjolinir were amazing moments none the less
[7:04:00] <signedskater718> Black panther was more hype than endgame to me

[8:03:36] <Looboo> oh buffs are default?? or in darkui settings?
[8:03:46] <FriedRicePvP> default
[8:03:53] <FriedRicePvP> dark ui is for the health bars
[8:03:59] <Rollem> @phadelocke That's dope af then, nice

[8:04:02] <ItchyNutz> ESO is like Diablo, they stand the test of time. Fighting gets outdated but they last in my opinion
[8:04:14] <vernonunderscore> hi im new richard
[8:04:32] <Thomy___> pet!
[8:04:37] <FriedRicePvP> i play eso for the pvp. take keeps and battle in raids aka zerging. its fun
[8:04:41] <WafflesEVRYday> nothing against WOW, but the animations/design of the characters just dont draw me in like the other MMOs do. they look lowkey ugly lol
[8:04:43] <na_playss> Controller ?
[8:04:47] <WujekSado> Hello everyone - I'm heavily debating buying this game. How casual friendly is it? Is it hard to find a group to run trials / group dungeons for sets at endgame? I'm mostly a solo player, but I know this game requires grouping to do some content, hence the question. Any help's appreciated!
[8:05:08] <Cruaxh> whataaattt
[8:05:13] <Cruaxh> you playing ESO now?
[8:05:14] <FriedRicePvP> @WujekSado eso community is fairly freindle
[8:05:20] <Thomy___> @WujekSado the game is super casual friendly and endgame content difficult - people are the friendliest I ever met in an MMO
[8:05:32] <TheShadyGentleman> i might go back to the mmorpg world
[8:05:36] <Cruaxh> i wish I was US so I could play with you
[8:05:36] <FriedRicePvP> i would buy it when its on sale. like $10
[8:05:36] <phadelocke> @KingRichard You get champion points for playing Bgs
[8:05:40] <ItchyNutz> @wujeksado If you give it time, it’ll be a great game but community is great and you will prob need a group
[8:05:47] <Cruaxh> lel you're in the Apex zone

[8:06:04] <phadelocke> @KingRichard Yea so it helps out for those of us not 810 yet, and dont do a lot of pve or grinding
[8:06:07] <WujekSado> @Looboo so you had no trouble finding groups to play with?
[8:06:25] <itzjimmyboy> I love this game but I hate pvp in it
[8:06:25] <WafflesEVRYday> nah i mean its been ugly since i could remember. its very cartoonish but in a off putting way
[8:06:46] <Looboo> @WujekSado nah not at all, was doing a lot of dungeons and most people gave good advice and were patient
[8:06:47] <Cruaxh> wow nice outffit dude!

[8:07:37] <itzjimmyboy> @Lastk1ngz I love the PvE in this game but I also dont like pvp in most games
[8:07:41] <phadelocke> @KingRichard In morrowind there is a vendor, where you can pick up daily quests, get AP/Gold + CP , they got quest like win 3 bgs, play in 5 bgs, 1000 medal points (easy to do).

[8:08:14] <WujekSado> @FriedRicePvP so getting into this game without friends, it's relatively easy to get people for endgame trials / group dungs?
[8:08:17] <WafflesEVRYday> agreed about that tho. pvp is the main draw of these games. the combat here in ESO looks good :)
[8:08:19] <Killriu> @KingRichard open that uncracked trans item you just got our of thy reward of the worthy
[8:08:27] <TheRealestlSniker> average health pool nowadays is 28k
[8:08:28] <WujekSado> @FriedRicePvP that's really good to hear honestly.
[8:08:52] <Due179> how did you get 690? u feel new to the game
[8:08:53] <phadelocke> @NidNeutrino Yea, they have it set up for new players, and within the past year they made it more new friendly by offering more in game help/tutorials

[8:09:15] <WujekSado> @Looboo yeah but the hardest content requires a manual group. doesn't it?
[8:09:17] <ssgjluke> imo erseo is very beginner friendly and its prolly the best mmo out rn
[8:09:18] <sythen11488> this hurts
[8:09:19] <Mimic89_> duel me =D @KingRichard
[8:09:23] <olesmo> you should not xD
[8:09:35] <smoke_sleep_eat> That’s to much lmao

[8:09:46] <WafflesEVRYday> @NidNeutrino have you played other MMOs? once you get in your hooked for a while with these huge games lol

[8:10:05] <phadelocke> @WujekSado Yes its easy because there is a "dungeon finder" which queue you in with other people who do not have a group already and ppl like you who needs people to do dungeons, and for trials there are guilds specifically to doing those things
[8:10:07] <olesmo> cp scales down to the flat % value

[8:11:31] <smoke_sleep_eat> Just do alcast magsorc cp build lol
[8:11:36] <TheStarhammer> @KingRichard You didn't miss anything yet on WoW.... WoW is still strong. Many players have been playing the whole 15 years. Yes it has a stylized cartooney look. But that is what has given it its longevity. If anyone starts WoW now they definitely whould hop right into BFA though. Itsthe latest and best content. DO NOT listen to all the streamers and critics who play 16 hours a day. All their negativity stems from that. Normal people who have jobs and real lives will not run out of content. Jus
[8:11:46] <phadelocke> @NidNeutrino If your limited on budget, i would just buy the base game (has 1000s+ of hours of content), and cost $20, if you got extra money sitting around then getting the newest expansion collectors edition would be a good route (has the last two chapters) + base game but like $60-80? not sure

[8:51:29] <saiya_tv> @emdubb13 pc looks at the keybinds
[8:51:44] <Reborn968> @emdubb13 the skill got ZQF and mouse button its PC
[8:51:52] <phadelocke> @emdubb13 KR is playing on PC but on a controller,
[8:52:04] <phadelocke> @emdubb13 The game is so much better on PC than console if a person has the option to pick either one PC for sure
[8:52:10] <emdubb13> @saiya_tv true i was jus a bit confused im not TOO familiar with eso
[8:52:39] <Aceblair> @phadelocke Facts. I played console for 2 years and when I switched I noticed a huge difference
[8:52:43] <saiya_tv> @emdubb13 it's fine me neither lol. there are chances that he could be playing keyboard and mouse on console but that would be insanely surprising
[8:52:53] <emdubb13> @phadelocke i completely agree, i play on both saince my friends pc just died our only option to play together is console and its depressing compared to PC lmfao
