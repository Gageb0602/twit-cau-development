[0:45:22] <besynchronic> u gonna nuke ppl in pvp like ol days
[0:45:38] <hc_fletch> nothing stacks right now. event is over @KingRichard
[0:46:07] <2diee4> What race on magicka nighblade High elf or dark elf guys ??
[0:46:32] <portugueseblood> high elf is slightly better
[0:46:34] <N3IMY> 250%
[0:46:35] <gmoney170> high elf has more sustain I think
[0:46:43] <besynchronic> breton if u cant sustain
[0:46:45] <portugueseblood> high elf doesnt have more sustain
[0:46:47] <hc_fletch> gear out of the way, 150% from the mythic aetherials, however they are like 35k a pop. all training gear you wear does stack though @KingRichard
[0:46:54] <mrverminator> the king is back :)
[0:46:54] <besynchronic> hi elf dmg kajiyt for crit
[0:46:57] <besynchronic> kajit

[0:47:46] <PathOfShadows> Any sets you plan on running?
[0:47:46] <hc_fletch> magdk has a class spammable.... feelsbadman
[0:47:50] <Aurileus> must be thirsty for viewers he back to ESO Kappa
[0:48:01] <besynchronic> level it in BGs like a man
[0:48:06] <2diee4> High elf have reduces dmg taken when cast chanel ability 5% does nigblade any spel on cast time
[0:48:15] <absolutelyterribad> not lvl 10 yet @besynchronic
[0:48:19] <DaPessimist> this game pretty popular?>
[0:48:31] <ImNynex> Yo chat and @kingrichard what would u rate this on your top mmo list. I've been mainly into fps games but I'm trying to break into the mmo world wondering if this is a good game to start?? I'm on console so kinda limited
[0:48:40] <besynchronic> the daily bg at lvl gives hella xp
[0:48:40] <hc_fletch> no no no it is not. it is more enjoyable yes, but takes waaaaay longer @KingRichard
[0:48:44] <absolutelyterribad> leveling in battlegrounds is more effective than questing and cyrodiil leveling
[0:48:44] <portugueseblood> @2diee4 that cast passive is pretty useless
[0:48:46] <PathOfShadows> @DaPessimist dont know but its pretty good
[0:48:48] <viralchampion> you have to hir lvl 10 to to bgs
[0:48:49] <besynchronic> lvl 10 u can start
[0:48:57] <hc_fletch> as of right now, it is number 1 @ImNynex
[0:49:08] <hc_fletch> soooo much content to do with minimal upfront cost @ImNynex
[0:49:35] <PathOfShadows> Any sets you want to try out on necro?
[0:49:40] <ImNynex> ayye that's what I like to hear @hc_fletch
[0:50:20] <Drakoclaw111> I'd put eso at a tie with ffxiv
[0:50:20] <QUEENxyZEE> !uptime
[0:50:20] <Nightbot> 50 minutes 36 seconds
[0:50:31] <therealtorcher> alikirs desert anchors are a good way to level
[0:50:36] <Drakoclaw111> mainly because of eso's fun pvp
[0:50:40] <absolutelyterribad> @KingRichard I can also jewelry craft, what do you want as your second set?
[0:50:44] <hc_fletch> @KingRichard bg's are not any where near more efficient that just xp grinding, but it is more enjoyable @KingRichard
[0:50:52] <hc_fletch> didnt mean to @ twice

[0:52:23] <hc_fletch> i would recommend doing your daily bg once you hit level 10 . gives a ton of xp. after that it isnt worth it @KingRichard

[0:58:22] <getxnaked> @rsc_ironborn only for some people rn
[0:58:32] <rocki_road> @rsc_ironborn it‚Äôs June 4th for console it‚Äôs today for pc if you got Elsweyr sypherLOVE
[0:58:38] <hc_fletch> how are you on gold? @KingRichard
[0:58:51] <junky08> where did you get that mount?
[0:59:01] <halfofvoltron> Wish i played pc eso i have a ton of gold on ps4 eso i dont use
[0:59:02] <hc_fletch> you can look on inventory insight @KingRichard
[0:59:06] <crippinfn> @kingrichard if you have 3 ppl in your group you get 25% less xp if you have 2 you gain 10% but you can‚Äôt possibly grind skyreach by yourself
[0:59:22] <rocki_road> @junky08 it‚Äôs part of the Elsweyr pack when ordering
[0:59:30] <absolutelyterribad> its worth the xp loss
[0:59:49] <BoostedSlaps> Wait you can play necromancer alrdy?
[0:59:53] <Ezzahh> keem is doing friday fortnite and bansk and the rest of the faze clan has to pay tfue 60k for 3weeks during that tourney or w.e
[1:00:00] <absolutelyterribad> scrolls dont stack with ambrosia
[1:00:01] <rocki_road> 10% more xp than normal not less just to clarify sypherLOVE
[1:00:02] <PathOfShadows> @BoostedSlaps only on pc
[1:00:13] <King_Yotee> Yes
[1:00:26] <BoostedSlaps> @pathofshadows do I gotta buy the expansion first?
[1:00:40] <getxnaked> @boostedslaps ye
[1:00:43] <crippinfn> @kingrichard it‚Äôs easy if your 810 obviously you can do it by yourself but you can‚Äôt and it‚Äôs worth the xp loss
[1:00:44] <lobo516> How does faze owe tfue money?
[1:00:50] <getxnaked> getxnaked subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:00:56] <lobo516> Why
[1:00:57] <rocki_road> And skyreach is possible to do by yourself just not at that level, once you reach champion at a certain level you‚Äôre good sypherPOGGIES
[1:01:01] <BoostedSlaps> That‚Äôs cool ima try get it next month
[1:01:15] <BoostedSlaps> Well next week I think Kapp

[1:03:28] <getxnaked> wtf
[1:03:45] <speed_kills_twitch> you gonna put your cp in or nah?
[1:03:46] <remblish> LULW
[1:04:03] <NukaWorld> you prob have on the double tap setting
[1:04:04] <JonnnyFive> lolllll
[1:04:06] <NukaWorld> shut it off
[1:04:31] <Its_GriN> the king is back
[1:04:38] <hog_squeezer69> yes
[1:04:39] <Droxity> I almost bought this game but I heard it wasn't anything like Skyrim so I said nah.
[1:04:42] <speed_kills_twitch> derp
[1:04:52] <Opar_lung> CP is account so
[1:04:55] <alannitro17> Where is this?
[1:05:08] <hc_fletch> its an mmo so it cant be like skyrim @Droxity
[1:05:11] <absolutelyterribad> skyreach @alannitro17
[1:05:14] <getxnaked> why TF does a lv 6 do so much dmg. necro is broke
[1:05:23] <rocki_road> Yes LUL
[1:05:52] <coachstevesteve> richard i love the variety my man love to see you enjoying other games!
[1:05:54] <Droxity> @hc_fletch Idk man, when I play skyrim I imagine other people walking around in the game. I think it could work.
[1:06:08] <Droxity> But I probably would've enjoyed this game too.
[1:06:11] <speed_kills_twitch> probably the most efficient cp setup ive ever seen
[1:06:19] <absolutelyterribad> @getxnaked enemies in normal difficulty areas how low health and damage resistance, and im doing a lot of the damage in this scenario
[1:06:19] <getxnaked> variety streamers are the best
[1:06:38] <hog_squeezer69> yes it does
[1:06:47] <Im__MegaDeath> yeah its applied @KingRichard
[1:06:53] <hog_squeezer69> you get the full cp advantage, the level doesn't matter
[1:06:55] <King_Yotee> Yes
[1:06:56] <rocki_road> There‚Äôs more new people in the game now than ever so if you‚Äôre thinking of trying it now is a great time sypherQT
[1:07:06] <Tetterbomb> double tap to dodge?
[1:07:10] <Nightbot> Amazon Prime members get a free Twitch subscription every month. Link Your Account Here: twitch.amazon.com/prime and subscribe to KR for free!
[1:07:17] <hc_fletch> what do you have it bound to? @KingRichard
[1:07:20] <remblish> damn the cleave on that scythe is nuts
[1:07:27] <v8v10v12> Necro? cmonBruh
[1:07:45] <oucnmee> All these normies who think Richard is trying this game for the first time fengFail
[1:07:52] <getxnaked> @absolutelyterribad he just did a 14k crit. I have a 120cp sorc that I've never done a 14k crit with. I'm just confused
[1:08:13] <jtreviso> chat stam necro or magicka?
[1:08:16] <getxnaked> @absolutelyterribad I've only been playing a month. so much stuff to learn
[1:08:40] <getxnaked> @jtreviso I would think mag right?
[1:08:47] <speed_kills_twitch> alright brother, I have to go. You're welcome for the help. Good to see you being a Necro GOD
[1:08:50] <Stormadonn> stam
[1:08:56] <Stormadonn> Stam iw
[1:09:10] <Opar_lung> @getxnaked That sounds like your build is kinda wrong. But dps is partly scaled depending on resistances so you shouldnt try to compare too much
[1:09:11] <hog_squeezer69> stam necro is stronger but mag makes more fun
[1:09:12] <intothevoid7> i use double tap, so i double tap A or D
[1:09:13] <uber_ific> no
[1:09:13] <absolutelyterribad> I use a button instead of double tap
[1:09:14] <Jpeltor> @KingRichard Now all that's missing is leftylucy and a bottle of jim beam apple :)
[1:09:14] <hc_fletch> i used mouse scroll up and down @KingRichard
[1:09:20] <Kurosive> OMFG THE KING IS BACK
[1:09:28] <Tetterbomb> just press the direction you want to dodge
[1:09:29] <NukaWorld> nah take that off, it will fuck u in combat
[1:09:32] <hog_squeezer69> yes stam necro deals way more dmg in pve and pvp
[1:09:33] <gin_ryuu> side mouse button to dodge
[1:09:34] <SebVicious> @KingRichard Mouse button 4 or 5 to dodge
[1:09:36] <hc_fletch> stam necro is muuuuuch stronger
[1:09:45] <uber_ific> I use V for dodge
[1:09:47] <Starus16> Starus16 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hello kr have a bless day
[1:09:49] <Txhorns23> oh shiiiiiiit ESO
[1:09:52] <King_Yotee> Stam necro
[1:10:02] <getxnaked> @opar_lung I'm sure the build isn't what it should be but either way he's doesn't have a build at all and is doing more?
[1:10:20] <evandhalo> Rich are you building for pve or pvp
[1:10:29] <Eternal_Agony_> What level are you?
[1:10:32] <portugueseblood> @KingRichard you can disable it in gameplay
[1:10:34] <hc_fletch> their both good as hell so just play whatever you want to
[1:10:36] <portugueseblood> the double tap
[1:10:39] <intothevoid7> i never messed with the keybinding for dodge, i just double tap A or D to dodge left n right
[1:10:42] <spoonyhook> go to settings then gameplay
[1:10:46] <Opar_lung> @getxnaked But he is against super low resistances ennemies with all of his cp and a damage class xd
[1:10:50] <Grandpablackskin> the king is back omg
[1:10:57] <baghearuh> Friday Night Fortnite is back bang
[1:11:15] <baghearuh> Starting in two weeks
[1:11:22] <NukaWorld> in gamplay under combat
[1:11:26] <Godplar> Mag is just going to be harder to manage in pvp with all the micromanaging
[1:11:32] <getxnaked> @opar_lung oh alright. so the dmg resistance must be a huge.
[1:11:43] <Grandpablackskin> the first OG mag sorc
[1:11:44] <getxnaked> I need some major ESO schooling lol
[1:11:52] <Grandpablackskin> redguard mag sorc
[1:11:56] <na_playss> @intothevoid7 If you used to play shooters you often spam a and d a lot so atleast for me and my friend we Dodge even tho we dont want to LUL so i change the bind to
[1:12:07] <Opar_lung> @getxnaked Well try to 1V1 a lv 6

[1:18:11] <briindii> hello @KingRichard
[1:18:14] <Grandpablackskin> nah magicka is up right now
[1:18:20] <intothevoid7> why does your ui look console-ish is it cuz ur gamepad?
[1:18:30] <spoonyhook> Right!
[1:18:32] <hog_squeezer69> everything works if you're a good pvp player
[1:18:34] <athenzs> Yo what up homie @kingrichard
[1:18:38] <Grandpablackskin> mag sorc pet is the best atm broken
[1:18:52] <willhelm> king used to play gamepad before there was a console UI
[1:19:00] <Godplar> Mag will just be harder for the average player
[1:19:08] <willhelm> so this is all new to him
[1:19:12] <Neloth290> pet mag sorc was meta 1vx last patch and will probably be the same in elsewyr
[1:19:19] <athenzs> How is ur day chat and @kingrichard
[1:19:42] <intothevoid7> double tap will prob be your only choice
[1:19:43] <Tetterbomb> can you go other directions if you press them while dodging?
[1:19:47] <spoonyhook> @KingRichard tried setting it to a directional button?
[1:19:47] <absolutelyterribad> @KingRichard dodge rolling without a direction input defaults to backwards
[1:19:50] <oucnmee> gamepad is on
[1:19:54] <absolutelyterribad> @Tetterbomb yes
[1:19:57] <oucnmee> doesnt usually look like that
[1:20:00] <intothevoid7> ah ok
[1:20:00] <yoshicitync> any news on a new elder scroll
[1:20:02] <yoshicitync> s
[1:20:06] <Grandpablackskin> mag sorc has more huge heals like templar burst like nb tanker than a dk pet sorc is so easy to play its OP
[1:20:16] <evandhalo> You dodge in the direction you're walking/running
[1:20:19] <intothevoid7> yea like your loading screen looked diff than mine i was confused lol
[1:20:26] <oucnmee> @yoshicitync elder scrolls six has a teaser trailer
[1:20:40] <yoshicitync> nice i havent seen it

[4:45:40] <XNoteworthy> I wonder which will be better. stam or amg
[4:45:45] <wounde4d> @kingrichard Do you have the skyshard achievements on your other characters? They added the ability to buy skillpoints with crowns this patch if you have the achievements
[4:45:46] <XNoteworthy> redguard
[4:46:02] <shortangrygamer> No fucking way, the king is back
[4:46:07] <JustinL9965> when did he start this character? Today?
[4:46:21] <skygagex> monkaw
[4:46:23] <furbz325> @KingRichard there was a huge racial passive overhaul, redguard isnt so great at the moment, nord or orc for pvp imo
[4:46:35] <Casterial> Woah
[4:46:37] <Casterial> Red guard is godly
[4:46:38] <newsoccer345_TTV> Oh and just doing things like sports and having a life

[4:49:41] <death___reaper> why everyone saying eso pay2win

[4:49:59] <LilRampage93> ESO or Skyrim?

[5:00:20] <Kurosive> i see full necro squads in bgs on the way =/
[5:00:27] <XNoteworthy> You dont need Summerset, you can buy warden alone.
[5:00:29] <xplicitc> Pay 2 win...
[5:00:33] <XNoteworthy> Actually the only way you can get warden.
[5:00:36] <XNoteworthy> With crowns.
[5:00:38] <dasfischgesicht1> Is that Skyrim?
[5:00:53] <AnyApples> @wounde4d is it for each zone or only the tamriel skyshard hunter achievement?
[5:00:57] <SmokeFaker> are you going to play Classic?@KingRichard
[5:01:03] <newsoccer345_TTV> Tell @nightbot to say yes chat come on help me
[5:01:06] <TheLooseSkrew> @dasfischgesicht1 eso
[5:01:08] <XNoteworthy> I wouldnt consider it p2w, cause you still have to be a good player in PVP for it to be considered broke @xplicitc
[5:01:17] <XNoteworthy> @xplicitc Broke in the right hands.
[5:01:24] <dasfischgesicht1> @thelooseskrew thx
[5:01:49] <XNoteworthy> This pace hurts to watch lol...
[5:02:02] <wounde4d> @anyapples each zone you get the skyshards for gives you an achievement. The store lets you buy from each zone, you dont need to have collected every skyshard in the game

[5:08:02] <youaword> Dead
[5:08:10] <beverly_hills_ninja> The decrease in xp is too much for it to compensate for the time they clear it. No net gain
[5:08:14] <zoom51jr> @newsoccer345_TTV KingRichard
[5:08:17] <newsoccer345_TTV> @enmanuellf Ohhh si si si
[5:08:20] <AnyApples> @KingRichard Can you check to see how much it takes to purchase one zone of skyshard?
[5:08:21] <JustinL9965> @Godplar This game takes forever to level
[5:08:28] <TheLooseSkrew> what are yall hyped for this year

[5:09:25] <N1ghtmare84> charge your weapon king
[5:09:26] <Godplar> @justinl9965 It depends really. Gear , place and xp buffs make a huge difference. Plus the person that‚Äôs leveling you
[5:09:44] <beverly_hills_ninja> @absolutelyterribad He said 8, I'm going off that. I have no idea? If they're taking forever yeah it could be a gain, but idk honestly?

[5:23:16] <DeathsCohort> What's your thoughts on this game compared to other mmos like ffxi?
[5:23:19] <absolutelyterribad> orc has the highest weapon damage of all of them
[5:23:23] <furbz325> @idroptoomuch nord, orc for stam. breton or high elf for mag
[5:23:26] <newsoccer345_TTV> Yo does anyone in chat know where to get this game
[5:23:29] <absolutelyterribad> @awes0m the closest to that is warden or templar
[5:23:32] <idroptoomuch> you think they would be better stam or mag?
[5:23:36] <elcheesewheel> Breton is magic
[5:23:43] <sOxOsLive> what class you recommended for stamina Nightblade
[5:23:51] <DrillbitDeath> wait I thought the necro didnt release till the 4th
[5:23:51] <StacknBodiez> Lol ppl getting extorted for skyreach runs lol
[5:23:51] <elcheesewheel> Mag is easier if you‚Äôre new @idroptoomuch

[5:27:57] <furbz325> @KingRichard chest isnt worth clearing, more efficient to just clear the room and skip the chest
[5:29:31] <furbz325> @KingRichard do you know quarantine serk? thats the best spot for pure xp, fewer mobs though so less fighters guild
[5:29:59] <furbz325> northwest deshaan
[5:30:00] <absolutelyterribad> quarantine serk is great for fighters guild, not for regular xp
[5:30:03] <absolutelyterribad> youve got that around
[5:30:10] <FreeWilli4> @KingRichard what UI mod are you using?
[5:30:11] <furbz325> no
[5:30:14] <furbz325> you do
[5:30:20] <furbz325> fighters guild is only # of mobs
[5:30:28] <furbz325> so skyreach is best, because insane mob density
[5:30:33] <Jeezus23> !followage

[5:33:15] <furbz325> @KingRichard quarantine serk is the very northwest corner of deshaan. when you get to the wayshrine a quest giver comes up to you, you need to do the first part of the quest which takes 2 minutes then you can get into the grind spot. its amazing

[6:19:33] <Inked_j> wtf is this music tho bruh???
[6:20:14] <Rune317> How is ESO's enjoyability now compared to before your Fortnite days?
[6:20:36] <ColombianJS> The Numbers!!
[6:21:03] <theokc> people saying different things about this game. Is this game's combat system; free action mmo ( you need to aim in order to deal damage, ex : dragon nest) or target lock ( just click on enemy then cast spells, ex : wow: )
[6:21:24] <jmarz1112> you pull consistent viewers no matter whay game you play the goat FBCatch FBCatch <3
[6:21:46] <xplicitc> @theokc Play it yourself and find out
[6:21:48] <Shadowpat12> I think ur xp pot ran out King
[6:21:55] <furbz325> @theokc no tab targetting, single target abilities need a target or wont cast, AoEs can always be cast
[6:22:21] <Ultimexxx> @theokc its a auto target system, wherever you are aiming is the enemy your are going to hit with single target attacks.
[6:22:23] <theokc> @furbz325 appreciate for answer
[6:22:39] <xplicitc> Word
[6:22:41] <Shadowpat12> U didn't have it up last round either
[6:22:50] <furbz325> but if you are looking at a dude, the isngle target ability will hit him, so just light aiming
[6:23:01] <furbz325> not like BDO where the ability only goes where you aim regardless of target
[6:23:03] <AquaneerSupreme> whats the add on showing the dmg?
[6:23:37] <furbz325> those are the ingame damage numbers
[6:23:37] <theokc> @Ultimexxx thx for answer
[6:24:47] <Principeartas99> Yeah
[6:24:50] <furbz325> @KingRichard remember the spambush build? that shit was op
[6:25:04] <Nightbot> All my youtube content can be found here don't forget to subscribe https://www.youtube.com/user/21shard/videos
[6:25:32] <Ultimexxx> @theokc there is also dodge rolling in this game to avoid damage, cc breaks and then blocking mechanic which is essential too. the combat feels kind of simple like WoW but its really complex at the same time.
[6:25:50] <Drofnad> !addons
[6:26:20] <jamesyh555> This pvp?
[6:26:31] <Principeartas99> This isn‚Äôt pvp
[6:26:48] <Principeartas99> This is the best place to farm level in teso
[6:26:50] <dreamuwu> is this a delve? if so where and what is it called
[6:27:29] <furbz325> skyreach catacbombs in craglorn
[6:27:35] <theokc> @Ultimexxx soo you can dodge single aim attacks by dodging ? i ment like witcher 3 and ds 3
[6:27:38] <dreamuwu> thanks!
[6:28:05] <Ultimexxx> @theokc yeah if you time it right. there are frames you avoid all damage
[6:28:08] <furbz325> @theokc yes
[6:28:18] <jflash007> Hello
[6:28:28] <furbz325> you cant roll dodge AoE attacks
[6:28:31] <theokc> thx for answer guess i give a shot this game =)
[6:28:59] <Ultimexxx> yeah if you roll inside an aoe and are inside the aoe you still take damage
[6:28:59] <xplicitc> Fr Fr @KingRichard

[6:40:06] <phadelocke> Hire a lawyer or get legal guidance before signing anything
[6:40:07] <SimplyS4> We still aint heard from tfue
[6:40:08] <WafflesEVRYday> what happened?
[6:40:28] <jamesyh555> He‚Äôs suing faze @simplys4
[6:40:45] <chief_n_loud> #FreeTfue
[6:40:54] <WafflesEVRYday> :O
[6:40:55] <Izaslayer> honestly he shoulda been went solo
[6:40:58] <SimplyS4> @jamesyh555 we dont know how much involvement he has in it or what made him make this decision.
[6:41:19] <JRoberts_49> I mean they posted his contract that said they get 80 he gets 20 for brand deals
[6:41:23] <Izaslayer> yeah facts
[6:41:24] <JPulverizers> @wafflesevryday just sued faze for saying they take 80% from him
[6:41:29] <artbeon> making some good points King
[6:41:35] <jamesyh555> @simplys4 sorry I meant to reply to waffles who asked what happened
[6:41:36] <Hollywood_SeP> i think banks was also saying that tfue wouldnt be "tfue level" without faze which to some extent may be true
[6:41:39] <AltaWasTaken> sub
[6:41:47] <phadelocke> @KingRichard Banks stated that Faze only took 60k over a year + period while making millions. Not sure how accurate it is but i doubt he would say that if it werent true since it can be used against him in court
[6:41:48] <Izaslayer> he could've bought an island by now
[6:41:51] <artbeon> 100 percent fact
[6:41:53] <xplicitc> Hopefully after King gets his views out there the chat doesnt get taken over by the negative shit

[6:43:44] <VeggieSticks2> sorry caps lock
[6:43:45] <jamesyh555> @simplys4 that said I believe his decision is based on not being able to purse sponsorship and revenue deals (he‚Äôs the one of the biggest streamers on twitch look at Ninja making red bull money for example) but his faze contract is allegedly preventing him pursuing it

[6:47:18] <phadelocke> Tfue trying to use this to get out of his contract , doubt he will want to enter another one lol
[6:47:35] <rjjryan1> seems like he could of renegotiated the contract if he was unhappy
[6:47:38] <Lapp_> @simplys4 it‚Äôs a Jebaited
[6:47:51] <Tee_0513> no more apex?
[6:47:53] <bigmac420chitown> Harry Potter ur self kingrichOmega kingrichOmega kingrichOmega kingrichOmega kingrichOmega
[6:47:58] <Bohners> why is that a harry potter ?
[6:48:00] <Izaslayer> it's called esports people
[6:48:08] <Mr_killorbekilled> I just think ppl are seeing the kid for who he really is. Never pose to bite the hand that feeds you
[6:48:11] <og_bobby_brackets> Is tfue just the lonzo ball of esports and his dad is lavar? Thoughts
[6:48:14] <wlc05002> how you like the apex update KR?
[6:48:16] <Izaslayer> so racing isn't a sport then
[6:48:23] <Izaslayer> you're just driving
[6:48:38] <og_bobby_brackets> Itssss ya boy booby
[6:48:40] <phadelocke> @KingRichard Do these esports orgs bank it $$$?
[6:48:43] <lilgreenguy44> @og_bobby_brackets bro factsss
[6:48:46] <havocg4ming> Fortnite > Apex. Unfortunately true
[6:48:46] <rjjryan1> banks said in his video he would of renegotiated but Turner never reached out
[6:48:48] <WafflesEVRYday> this is why ppl should try to get short contracts with expiration dates that have to be renewed. it could help in the long run
[6:49:09] <Sp0oKy_Jay> Is there a new fortnite Friday thing going on @kingrichard
[6:49:16] <Jonataan0> he knows how mutch money he could lose if faze gets 20% or even 10% of the money.
[6:49:24] <Hollywood_SeP> @WafflesEVRYday literally the opposite of what people want, you want longevity both as a player and as an org
[6:49:27] <JPulverizers> @izaslayer I mean I don't see it as a sport but my grandpa loves it haha so I root for it
[6:49:27] <Jonataan0> in world cup
[6:49:30] <JRoberts_49> The lawsuit says he tried to renegotiate in September
[6:49:33] <phadelocke> @rjjryan1 Yea that is what was reported, Faze tried to renegotiate but he wasnt interested.
[6:49:39] <Izaslayer> why reach out to a slime when you realize they been screwing you
[6:49:40] <SimplyS4> B hamzOMEGALUL T
[6:49:54] <Bohners> tbag him plz
[6:49:57] <phadelocke> @Jonataan0 Faze reported they only got $60k out of the millions he made and it was only brand deals that they brought to him
[6:50:09] <og_bobby_brackets> Tufffff
[6:50:27] <ysb_boogie> EVERYBODY MAD
[6:50:30] <Izaslayer> @jpulverizers I feel ya lol
[6:50:35] <rotn_r3ptil3> fouseySHAME
[6:50:38] <JRoberts_49> FaZe shady as hell. That‚Äôs why 72hrs left and why turner is suing. They‚Äôre not even addressing the fact that they hired an 11 yea role
[6:50:40] <SimplyS4> chat ResidentSleeper
[6:50:45] <JRoberts_49> Year old
[6:50:45] <WafflesEVRYday> i just feel like he (Tfue) would have more control if the contract was shorter. he could just let it run out and not renew @Hollywood_SeP
[6:50:47] <exstezz> MrDestructoid
[6:50:59] <queenjeebies> i love the song that playing so much kingrich10
[6:51:01] <ysb_boogie> I think its deeper than Faze Im telling yall ima call it @KingRichard Tfue dad is going to exploit his son

[6:51:14] <wlc05002> @KingRichard how do you like the apex update?
[6:51:15] <beefish33> I think yall care too much about strangers business
[6:51:19] <artbeon> why is it such a big deal that they signed an 11 year old
[6:51:20] <SimplyS4> @xplicitc ResidentSleeper
[6:51:21] <justchesss> only 4 more left
[6:51:23] <Hollywood_SeP> @WafflesEVRYday this is all in hindsight, tfue was nobody until the past year, he wasnt lebron james day 1
[6:51:28] <phadelocke> Tfue was drinking before he even joined Faze lol
[6:51:28] <havocg4ming> Who cares not our problem
[6:51:31] <JPulverizers> @izaslayer all respect to drivers though that are racing for their job. I do believe if I had the chance to drive their car though I would drive just like them .
[6:51:31] <ysb_boogie> Tfue has been drinking before he got to Faze
[6:51:32] <erfan_shm> Hi

[7:01:07] <jamesyh555> @mostdopekyliee he‚Äôs being diplomatic, he likes faze as a company and faze banks and hopes there‚Äôs no wrongdoing and he also supports tfue as a fellow streamer, pro and content creator. He said there are people getting fucked over out there and things esports contracts should be public similar to American football, basketball etc
[7:01:10] <havocg4ming> Yea the shotgun is nice and you have to hit your shots
[7:01:10] <Bohners> i hate combat shotgun
[7:01:18] <letsgetitbroooo> What u think about the whole true situation?
[7:01:41] <Izaslayer> shotgun is cow dung
[7:01:44] <xplicitc> @letsgetitbroooo Already stated his views
[7:01:47] <mostdopekyliee> @xplicitc ohhh okay, so tfue is sueing faze right? Bc they are taking 80% of his earnings?
[7:01:49] <tiwinn> Bust his ass @kingrichard
[7:02:04] <cyberspectra> @jamesyh555 With the amount of money esports is bringing in all contracts should be transparent

[7:02:25] <thekidlarry17> Yah bein apart of a org can be good but if you gain alot of popularity i feel its better to be on your own to better your career
[7:02:26] <PURPLEBUTTONSS> fortnite needs the hardcore community that plays this game day and night to make desicions on whether or not to change up the mechanic cuz casuals that play for 1 hour every month shouldn't be the audience fortnite wanna please because they just play to play

[7:03:52] <Slowfool123> Didnt even know tfue was in faze
[7:03:53] <Izaslayer> bro... let's be honest he's carrying faze
[7:03:54] <jamesyh555> It‚Äôll be 100T Cloak and Tfue
[7:03:54] <letsgetitbroooo> So what even happen?
[7:03:58] <phadelocke> @KingRichard What made you join an org? Sounds like your semi against them
[7:03:58] <cyberspectra> I started watching true after he played with dk, he wasn‚Äôt faze then
[7:04:00] <justooo19> Factual statement üíØ
[7:04:04] <cyberspectra> Tfue*
[7:04:05] <thekidlarry17> Honestly up until tfue was on faze i didnt even think faze was a fortnite team
[7:04:11] <PURPLEBUTTONSS> jaoFaze
[7:04:11] <tiwinn> Doesnt matter to me i watch @kingrichard
[7:04:16] <justooo19> üíØ
[7:04:21] <ysb_boogie> I agree with that too. somebody would have found him
[7:04:24] <str8rydda> True, but he neeed an org
[7:04:28] <alpha__status> Big facts
[7:04:30] <thekidlarry17> He made them fortnite pipular imo
[7:04:39] <brainal_beads> Is that really the point though? The Org helped him and he signed the contact
[7:04:40] <itsKR7> Bullshit. He would be successful but nowhere near as big as he is now without banks
[7:04:41] <alpha__status> You don‚Äôt even need an org to be honest lmao
[7:04:43] <Bohners> Liquid Tfue Liquid Cloakzy
[7:05:03] <ysb_boogie> @KingRichard according to banks he would have never got that spot in Friday night fortnite
[7:05:05] <amardave> where has kingrichardsloot been?
[7:05:06] <wiggy204> Cloak ain‚Äôt leaving lol
[7:05:10] <havocg4ming> I think Tfue made Faze on the contrary as far as Fortnite goes
[7:05:13] <Bohners> look at aipha bot,
[7:05:13] <marcusboc> @kingrichard I think they should release his contract details so we could see if they actually take 80% of his money
[7:05:19] <PURPLEBUTTONSS> @itsKR7 thats half of it but banks did do a lot to encourage tfues career and life
[7:05:22] <Izaslayer> look at the new west qualifier
[7:05:26] <phadelocke> Tfue is not going to another org, he is blowing this whole thing up to get out of one, why would he do that just to join another
[7:05:29] <letsgetitbroooo> How do i see how long i been followed?
[7:05:29] <lmv1onxbox> i think the reason banks got code tfue tatted on him because he got half of the money
[7:05:36] <eatgrasslikeass> i hate these kids saying Banks made him, he found him when he only had 100 views, that doesnt mean its okay for the org to take 80% or any huge amount.
[7:05:39] <tiwinn> Lesson is read your contracts kids
[7:05:42] <Izaslayer> 13 year old kid going to world's no org
[7:05:45] <JayDeGz1> He can make more off of his name now
[7:05:46] <jamesyh555> Let‚Äôs not forget that when tfue signed the most competitive thing about Fortnite was pros killing bots in pubs trying to get more kills than other pros
[7:05:53] <SimplyS4> Tfue became big mainly from Friday Fortnite, duo'ing with Cloakzy
[7:05:53] <thekidlarry17> Tfues finna go solo an get the mfn bagggg
[7:05:54] <notwalkindead> @kingrichard You and Calvin gotta make a comeback on these Friday Fortnites
[7:06:05] <joshorange1997> wasnt Tfue on Rouge first too......
[7:06:10] <cracker90006> Hmm
[7:06:27] <zestiify_> Watch faze banks video and he‚Äôll explain everything
[7:06:30] <HOPEFULVETERAN> Morning chat kingrichLove
[7:06:34] <jamesyh555> Tfue has 220,000 viewers on Sunday
[7:06:34] <thekidlarry17> He prolly got offers from like redbull but couldnt take it bc of fazes contract
[7:06:34] <letsgetitbroooo> !ft
[7:06:37] <Slowfool123> Skadoodle gets like 500 views
[7:06:44] <thekidlarry17> Hes fonna go solo an rep alot of popular brands
[7:06:44] <brainal_beads> I understand the frustration of being saddled with a bad contract, but I don't understand the 'victim' rhetoric
[7:06:46] <cyberspectra> @zestiify_ That‚Äôs only one side
[7:06:49] <str8rydda> To actually blow up the way he did, he needed the org
[7:06:50] <phadelocke> @KingRichard When we going to see KR on some can of soda
[7:06:51] <joshorange1997> that vid is one side
[7:06:51] <WafflesEVRYday> that fuckin samsung money. sheesh
[7:06:52] <JRoberts_49> they confirmed faze gets 80% of brand deals is in the contract.
[7:06:54] <marcusboc> @kingrichard still think he should expose the contract details
[7:06:55] <musslod> !pc
[7:07:00] <letsgetitbroooo> How do I see how long i been followed?

[7:07:15] <connorbp1> Watch banks video
[7:07:17] <marcusboc> @kingrichard still think he should expose the contract details!
[7:07:31] <williamatthew5> all this faze stuff is making me confuzzled
[7:07:32] <ChrisppApples> ORGS don't pick up players to make them BIG.... They pick up players that are going to be BIG ALREADY!
[7:07:35] <JRoberts_49> @letsgetitbroooo followage command
[7:07:36] <itsmitsukii> Apex?
[7:07:41] <aliemnm> faze just jumpstarted it
[7:07:45] <jamesyh555> Ninja making bank, uber eats, red bull, final mouse etc... tfue is currently more popular than him and is missing out on that kind of sponsorship because of his org
[7:07:47] <SimplyS4> I REMEMBER , you already talked about it LUL
[7:07:52] <Izaslayer> ^^^^

[7:07:52] <Nightbot> https://twitch.center/follow
[7:07:53] <lmv1onxbox> he was berly getting any views into he joined faze so faze made tfue
[7:07:53] <connorbp1> Watch faze banks new video
[7:07:54] <smrtyjones> Orgs seem like they should serve as support
[7:08:00] <Izaslayer> what Chris said
[7:08:01] <Dj_rida> chat, what's the ninja and tfue drama? I hear people talking about it but never paid attention
[7:08:03] <UncleKooper1> Tfue starting popping off in H1Z1 he would have been fine without faze he would still win tournaments without them
[7:08:13] <cracker90006> When faze banks made multiple tweets about the drama, he took it emotional and since then Idk who to feel bad for FeelsConfusingMan
[7:08:16] <demonShoota> !uptime
[7:08:16] <Nightbot> 7 hours 8 minutes 32 seconds
[7:08:18] <phadelocke> The owner of Faze said that Tfue only had 100 viewers when they signed him, not sure if there is a place to verify those #'s
[7:08:18] <blueberrygames44> Kingrichard have you ever been apart of an org
[7:08:23] <ChrisppApples> Aint no orgs looking for people to blow up lol
[7:08:35] <HOPEFULVETERAN> cmonBruh
[7:08:35] <Nightbot> cmonBruh
[7:08:39] <TheYodelers> Noice
[7:08:49] <wiggy204> @blueberrygames44 Dumb question lol
[7:08:52] <marcusboc> @kingrichard what part of ny are you from or is that too personal I think west Chester?!?
[7:08:55] <tiwinn> He big mad
[7:08:56] <letsgetitbroooo> I followed u April 29 2018 a year ago
[7:08:57] <lmv1onxbox> the reason clans/orgs knew about tfue was because of banks
[7:08:59] <jamesyh555> Orgs aren‚Äôt charities they don‚Äôt pick random people and make them successful lmao
[7:09:01] <phadelocke> cmonBruh cmonBruh
[7:09:10] <thekidlarry17> No tfue def only had like 100 viewers but no doubt whereber he signed he woulda still been droppin 30 bombs gainin popularity bc hes a god
[7:09:25] <Chrisb_09> @kingrichard what‚Äôs good brother
[7:09:27] <brainal_beads> cheer500 But by that logic doesnt it mean he had all the opportunity to make an informed decision? I don't see how he is the victim
[7:09:28] <cyberspectra> Faze was kind of fading anyways before tfue blew them back up like they used to be.
[7:09:35] <Izaslayer> yeah he is more poppin den ninja he had like 200k watching him.. didn't think about how much he missing out on
[7:09:39] <marcusboc> @kingrichard what part of ny are you from or is that too personal I think west Chester?!
[7:09:41] <itwasntajoke> Hey

[7:10:23] <Hodstocktony> dubs and meega just got signed cause of how good they doing and faze wants that chedda
[7:10:27] <Izaslayer> a lot going on. myth moved houses too lol
[7:10:28] <joshorange1997> Sep 2017 - Mar 2018 He was with Rouge so yes Faze helped but so did Rouge and mostly Tfue did THE WORK. Facts KR!
[7:10:29] <SimplyS4> literally friday fortnite blew him up
[7:10:33] <marcusboc> @kingrichard so who do you support?
[7:10:34] <joshorange1997> Preach
[7:10:34] <Hi_iTzAlex> Faze created Tfue
[7:10:35] <RSGBrandon> yes but he wouldnt have been in friday fortnite had he not been on faze tbh
[7:10:44] <JayDeGz1> @phadelocke Fair enough
[7:10:50] <Bohners> ninjaTooth
[7:10:51] <lmv1onxbox> cloak didn‚Äôt wanna play with tfue in the beginning of him joining faze

[7:11:15] <joshorange1997> Hi_iTzAlex: wrong
[7:11:21] <Izaslayer> let's be real guys.. turner is way better than any member on faze
[7:11:28] <lmv1onxbox> kinda got a feeling he wants more clout and make faze look bad
[7:11:28] <rjohnson117> Shit
[7:11:34] <phadelocke> @JayDeGz1 Just saying because faze claims they only made $60k off tfue, if thats true then thats pretty low. I think both will be fine without one another, but i guess its good drama it allows us to read about it xD
[7:11:35] <itsmitsukii> I knew him after faze lmao, if it wasn‚Äôt faze then why should I even spend one second on his stream
[7:11:35] <ieyesee> Thought on tfue
[7:11:36] <xplicitc> @marcusboc Don't do that.

[7:20:05] <pistolmaravich> orgs will be fine either way LUL
[7:20:06] <xplicitc> @Bohners and when did he say that?
[7:20:07] <Bohners> @simplys4 wow lol
[7:20:09] <Montyptv> Is it weird that kingrichard always responds to my comment
[7:20:10] <cyberspectra> @hi_itzalex Yeah I read it lol, faze banks is saying it‚Äôs all a bunch of bullshit
[7:20:13] <Izaslayer> okay plae... I like it

[7:22:41] <fasinehdadolphin> In other games you gotta rely on the orgs to get you sponsors
[7:22:42] <brainal_beads> You just said TFue talked to all the orgs. Still signed the contract. So what the problem?
[7:22:48] <xplicitc> @astrofn_wildbull Already been through that
[7:22:48] <Steembo> Legally speaking, all of tfues claims are childish. Any org, especially faze, wouldn‚Äôt make a contract that they won‚Äôt follow themselves. Giving a comp player 20% of revenue when the contract states differently is unheard of, especially depending on influence. He‚Äôs gonna lose this and learn how ridiculous it was to even file the suit. He absolutely needed an org for Fortnite Friday as well. Fat L
[7:22:52] <pistolmaravich> let‚Äôs just be real about it tfues too big for an org no org can bring him anything that benefits him so of course he doesn‚Äôt want to be in it

[7:26:11] <notwalkindead> You need a lawyer before you start looking at orgs that wanna sign you before you get in a shitty contract
[7:26:12] <daaxx19> Hey KR, hey chat
[7:26:16] <Hi_iTzAlex> Orgs need a lot more incentives nowadays
[7:26:21] <daaxx19> Hows everyone doing

[7:26:27] <Bohners> Ninja is the best @kingrichard
[7:26:28] <yaaaabuddy8823> they've been negotiating his contract for months to accomodate tfue, im sure that they don't even care about the money owed but in his contract theres no way they agreed to 0% twitch revenue, youtube revenue, and social platform
[7:26:31] <electric_gynecologist> tfue needed faze for fortnite Friday entry, the deff helped him rise sooner
[7:26:38] <ZigZack> cause he hits those!!

[7:28:27] <Zaunderz> said*
[7:28:29] <F0dg3t> Drake bacame famous playin with ninja
[7:28:30] <bentley1313> I find no twitch streamer will make it if you don‚Äôt live in America and don‚Äôt play na servers
[7:28:31] <Sp3tz_D3agl3> @brainal_beads what you smoking?
[7:28:33] <BinoMOBB> @KingRichard truth my brother preach on
[7:28:36] <AltaWasTaken> whoever just said that is a dumbass @kingrichard
[7:28:37] <iloveallwoman> oh snap!
[7:28:39] <Izaslayer> just like being with a popping stylist if you dress trash no one gonna work with you
[7:28:39] <Wotless> dont you play apex anymore?
[7:28:43] <pistolmaravich> reverse still averages like 1.5k viewers and he‚Äôs a beast and plays w ninja daily so no ninja can‚Äôt just make someone career
[7:28:43] <cyberspectra> I found you before I even knew who ninja was, that‚Äôs not true you had as many or more viewers back then
[7:28:46] <fasinehdadolphin> Dude said drake became famous LOL
[7:29:00] <BlueMoonHS> I am trash at Fortnite but I could 1v1 you :) @kingrichard

[7:29:03] <electric_gynecologist> someone told highdistortion CDN made him, but what about all the smaller streamers cdn games with
[7:29:07] <sterbenviixii> gotta agree, too many peoples focused on the Image other than the skill.
[7:29:11] <AltaWasTaken> @kingrichard he don't know wtf he's talking about
[7:29:16] <JGOD_Gaming> @KingRichard perfect example of that is when ninja has raided/hosted x streamer a dozen times, but that streamer still doesnt hold over 1k viewers.
[7:29:18] <tavinlolol> my man was playing fucking eso before he started playing fn like gtfo
[7:29:21] <Bohners> ninja made drake album blow up ninjaClap
[7:29:22] <KempyTV> i agree @KingRichard , Ninja obviously gave you exposure but ninja wanted to play with you because you're a fucking beast at the game.

[7:30:04] <phadelocke> @KingRichard Also one of the few streamers to not just stick to fortnite due to its popularity but i notice your one of the few popular fortnite streamers to play variety games.
[7:30:06] <Hi_iTzAlex> Drake became famous cause of ninja
[7:30:06] <pistolmaravich> @yaaaabuddy8823 didn‚Äôt see your message what did you ask?

[7:30:31] <jamesyh555> There‚Äôs so much going into this. Fear itself is a great gamer, plays with Lupo, Ninja, Tim and that cohort a lot and just reached 150k followers today whereas King has 1.5 million. There is no formula for success that works for everyone

[7:33:20] <JustBasicGirlGamer> What is your take in having a group or a clan?
[7:33:29] <AyalX> go to bed boi CoolCat
[7:33:30] <pistolmaravich> @yaaaabuddy8823 even if he did agree to let‚Äôs say 10% of his revenue goes to them he would of been paying that because that money would hit the org before tfues bank it‚Äôs a contract
[7:33:31] <electric_gynecologist> they apparently give football players alot of opiates
[7:33:40] <ysb_boogie> Imagine
[7:33:43] <SimplyS4> yeah its getting old quick hamzSleep
[7:33:45] <raholi95> @yaaaabuddy8823 Exactly. Noticed they wrote that nothing has been "collected" . THeres is some shady stuff going on and to be honest Faze Banks might not even know about it
[7:33:51] <dtynes242> do you think a lot of professional gamers are being jerked by orgs?
[7:33:52] <Bohners> do u speak arbic
[7:33:53] <xplicitc> @tylerjarecki He's in the middle of a match and can you not hear him talking?
[7:33:55] <beefish33> @justbasicgirlgamer Pretty irrelevant for fortnite
[7:33:56] <blacklist_exe> Damn son

[7:34:20] <pistolmaravich> tfue won‚Äôt speak on it till the lawsuit is done
[7:34:24] <tylerjarecki> @xplicitc I can I just need to talk to him privately for a second
[7:34:37] <blacklist_exe> I got some homies in faze, known them for years, mod for them for years too, they love where they are.. All a weird situation but I guess time will show everything
[7:34:41] <a_sentret> @yaaaabuddy8823 he wasn't a nobody and also why would anybody agree to that? orgs almost always just help hook you up with sponsorships and take a cut from those deals and the only time i've ever seen them take part of tourny winnings is when theres a whole team of players a part of the tourny
[7:34:43] <alecjewell1> What if it‚Äôs a prank to the internet
[7:34:48] <electric_gynecologist> it almost sounds like tfue didn't want this to go public but speculation
[7:34:50] <jamesyh555> Yup anything Tfue says will be through his lawyer
[7:34:51] <Deaglesun> are you going to play duos with DK?
[7:34:55] <snizzzy1> wonder if he can even stream until then. Hes chat will be wildin
[7:35:00] <xplicitc> @cracker90006 It's not on you to make conclusions. The situation is what it is and he'll deal with it his way
[7:35:08] <cracker90006> @pistolmaravich then I‚Äôll wait after lawsuit
[7:35:19] <yaaaabuddy8823> @pistolmaravich yea and in the mean time they've constantly been working on an agreement for a new contract that was never met, therefore I believe he's been holding out on paying them money owed

[7:35:53] <raholi95> It just doesnt seem like a good plan to completely make this shit up for Tfue . I dont think he would have to make up such a ridiculous number to get released.
[7:35:54] <DoyLy> thats emadgg
[7:35:59] <electric_gynecologist> 360 no scope!!
[7:36:06] <Hi_iTzAlex> Give it about 6months guys Faze will settle with Tfue on a undisclosed amount and things will be back to normal this will not go to court.

[7:38:49] <ChrisppApples> ORGS are doing hardcore business with Gamers that have no clue.
[7:38:54] <electric_gynecologist> emadd turtles in pubs like psalm turtles in comp??
[7:38:54] <phadelocke> @KingRichard Why didn't you get a lawyer to review your contract?
[7:38:59] <SimplyS4> @blacklist_exe do like your name says and start blacklisting CoolStoryBob
[7:39:01] <tfue_the_best_> who is the victem
[7:39:09] <yaaaabuddy8823> @KingRichard do organizations usually take percentages of twitch revenue and social media platforms ??
[7:39:11] <jamesyh555> @blacklist_exe it‚Äôs been like that this stream but KR has been too so if the streamer talking about the chat are gonna carry on lol
[7:39:14] <tylerjarecki> yo king

[7:39:50] <kinghustlin> Tfue was 20 last year when he got signed
[7:39:56] <blacklist_exe> @jamesyh555 If he's cool with it no problem lol, he's happy to talk about it, I only got here 10 mins ago and seen the same questions he's answered being asked over and over
[7:40:07] <dtynes242> how many young gamers do you think that happens to?
[7:40:07] <Bohners> 1k a month back then loool
[7:40:08] <baghearuh> When I was 18 I barely knew how to sign my contract with T-Mobile
[7:40:09] <pixyyyy> Faze up
[7:40:12] <K0YER> Fax
[7:40:13] <tfue_the_best_> faze bank blamend tfue
[7:40:15] <almightygod4> LULW
[7:40:15] <jamesyh555> Yeah he‚Äôs worth more to them than they are to him
[7:40:16] <bigmac420chitown> that would be crazy if they never restructured his contract
[7:40:25] <Izaslayer> those pistols are so rng it's gross
[7:40:26] <ChrisppApples> Lawyers don't know what's fair in esports cause esports is new and the info is either behind NDA's or no disclosed.
[7:40:32] <MisterGLive> this man was crouch walking behind tables LUL
[7:40:35] <blacklist_exe> When I was 18 I liked to get drunk and gambling took all my money 100% to them and 0% to me fuck my life
[7:40:36] <1RW_chel18> you've always seemed genuine in a world of fake streamers looking to become big. I've never got the window dressing feel from you. we appreciate your grind my man. @kingrichard
[7:40:38] <a_myhand> Ayyy FN Lets GOOOOOOOOOOO
[7:40:41] <baghearuh> I got that free Razor phone and thought I was big time
[7:40:41] <tfue_the_best_> said he was a good digger
[7:40:41] <bl88d_> @blacklist_exe, ban the whole chat
[7:40:41] <cracker90006> I mean he was the witness sooo (I might be wrong idk)
[7:40:49] <yaaaabuddy8823> @bigmac420chitown they tried to restructure im sure they just never met an agreement
[7:40:52] <jamesyh555> @blacklist_exe I think KR got some knowledge on this shit and doesn‚Äôt mind talking about it. But you know twitch people always be spamming the same stuff on repeat
[7:41:01] <Hi_iTzAlex> @bigmac420chitown sounds like they tried but Tfue sees he can make way more out on his own and they wouldn‚Äôt terminate his contract
[7:41:03] <onecaka> check bsnks new vid if u need info @KingRichard
[7:41:04] <K0YER> I love faze but I hate the whole clout thing
[7:41:06] <thekidlarry17> They never restructured it
[7:41:07] <Blunt_Box> it was 3 yr i think
[7:41:07] <cyberspectra> I still have a hard time talki to people at fast food restaurant about what I want to eat, let alone talking and understanding a contracts LUL
[7:41:08] <phadelocke> @KingRichard Faze said that they tried to renegotiate his contract but he refused.
[7:41:10] <thekidlarry17> 3 yr deal
[7:41:11] <K0YER> It was a three year deal
[7:41:13] <pistolmaravich> apparently it was originally a 6 month contract that would be automatically renewed for 3 MORE YEARS there‚Äôs no amount of anything that tfue could of gotten from them that benefits him @kingrichard
[7:41:16] <tfue_the_best_> he didn't read contract probly
[7:41:21] <thekidlarry17> They tried to restructure but never did
[7:41:21] <blacklist_exe> Yeah I feel you, you right @jamesyh555 New dudes coming in asking for opinions too
[7:41:32] <DoyLy> it was a 3 year contract and they were working on a restructure and tfue, his dad and his lawyer didn't agree with it
[7:41:38] <ChrisppApples> Ask an org how much they make on a specific sponsorship what they promissed the sponsor that their players would do for the money.
[7:41:44] <cyberspectra> @thekidlarry17 That‚Äôs what they say...
[7:41:50] <raholi95> @KingRichard Faze Banks confirmed that Tfue is on the same 3 year deal and he says they tried to renegotiate but never got it done.
[7:41:51] <Hi_iTzAlex> Gotta read that FINE ladies & gentlemen Kappa
[7:41:51] <str8outtajersey3> It‚Äôs a 3 year deal and they tried to renegotiate n he wasn‚Äôt having it ... tfue also refused any monthly money they offered him @kingrichard
[7:41:55] <Hi_iTzAlex> Print*
[7:41:58] <dtynes242> no 18 yr old kid is reading it or knows the jargon
[7:42:00] <blacklist_exe> I hear tfue has now signed to the LA Lakers
[7:42:03] <pixyyyy> Faze did nothing wrong, why would they target just tfue
[7:42:05] <Izaslayer> they making millions guys..
[7:42:08] <Nightbot> Follow KR on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KingRichard
[7:42:10] <hyper_poker1> Tfue wants all the money of the world cup
[7:42:12] <pistolmaravich> @chrisppapples facts... i bet tfue was the main selling point for so many sponsors
[7:42:15] <phadelocke> we in the wrong business chat, we need to create a esports org and sign all the kids
[7:42:18] <electric_gynecologist> why are we on this hyped speculation bs. CarlSmile
[7:42:18] <jamesyh555> I‚Äôm sure at the time tfue was happy with it but things change
[7:42:21] <cracker90006> That joke ninja did about the drama tho lol
[7:42:21] <Izaslayer> @blacklist_exe I thought it was golden state
[7:42:21] <numiockk> the dumb here is banks he needs a PR
[7:42:25] <bigmac420chitown> that's kinda they parents fault their are under 18 at least
[7:42:32] <EerieViolet> even if you read it a lot of cases with contracts they make that shit vague and confusing as fuck
[7:42:38] <Bohners> corrina wants it ll
[7:42:41] <blacklist_exe> As I said, I've been friends with some faze dudes for years, they've never had any problems and idk, seems all sus to me
[7:42:41] <bigmac420chitown> get a lawyer to look at the contract if needed
[7:42:45] <zibii_> yeah hes signed with the same contract because tfue refused every new contract so maybe he planned this
[7:42:47] <jamesyh555> In sport people sign 5 year contracts and then get bought by another team for cash and then the contract goes out of the window
[7:42:49] <phadelocke> @jamesyh555 Yea like his channel booming and dollar signs lol
[7:42:49] <SimplyS4> you dont need a scar and an infantry
[7:42:53] <K0YER> @cracker90006 What was the joke?
[7:42:55] <yaaaabuddy8823> I really think faze didnt do anything wrong either. just like people are saying "its business" so is a contract. if u truly believe your going to blow up or be better on ur own in years to come don't sign a long contract. he beat himself
[7:42:56] <baghearuh> King needs to create his own E Sports Team and sign Ninja
[7:43:00] <tfue_the_best_> but many people said true just want money but that's a lie

[7:43:20] <pixyyyy> Yo chat just killed parallel scar, is he real or na?
[7:43:22] <0subtrain> No gold scar? You‚Äôre crazy
[7:43:30] <NatesUhTank> Leaves gold scar weird flex
[7:43:37] <blacklist_exe> A dude who plays game, a company coming to him with a contract.. Of course they're gonna sign without reading the details, it's the dream
[7:43:38] <Bohners> i heard tfue going broke and he needs this money ninjaCreep
[7:43:41] <Hi_iTzAlex> No one knew Tfue was going to blow up like he did and Not even Tfue so now he wants to earn as much as he can with no org
[7:43:45] <tfue_the_best_> trick shot
[7:43:50] <jamesyh555> @0subtrain KR be hitting his infantry shots tbf
[7:43:57] <Moe_Green13> I think he‚Äôs doing all this to get onto 100 thieves
[7:43:59] <CaLiKiLLiN> tSUE ammoBran
[7:44:01] <numiockk> the reason we are not hearing anything from tfue is because his team is doing everything perfectly whereas faze just handled it unprofessionally
[7:44:03] <pixyyyy> No one took tfues money, he had bank

[7:44:16] <K0YER> I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Faze is lying tbh lmao. I bet they took hella money
[7:44:22] <0subtrain> Fax @jamesyh555 his aim nasty
[7:44:22] <phadelocke> @KingRichard Its a new industry but a lawyer can explain to you what your getting yourself into or if something seems odd. I need lawyers at times to help me with contracts because some of that shit is like a third language
[7:44:22] <Bohners> @moe_green13 y...does he even like them
[7:44:22] <bigmac420chitown> did u need an org for apex?
[7:44:28] <Calubos43> @kingrichard That's sad man Tfue got taken advantage of man.
[7:44:29] <bigmac420chitown> and the tourneys
[7:44:30] <Blunt_Box> arent u signed nrg tho?
[7:44:32] <mildlyblue> thats was so clean
[7:44:35] <jamesyh555> @kingrichard how many orgs you been with? NRG, Envy and then back to NRG?
[7:44:35] <epickilledfortnite> Bet you Tfue starts a waive and more ppl sue or back out of contracts. Renegotiate
[7:44:40] <owlsblgnd> half shield on top of other crib
[7:44:40] <pistolmaravich> no ones taking anything from tfue tbh i think this is all about reaching a settlement that involves him getting out of an org bc he doesn‚Äôt want to be signed
[7:44:41] <electric_gynecologist> by chat have fun BloodTrail. mods I'll be in stream only mode CoolStoryBob
[7:44:47] <pixyyyy> They got 60k from tfue, why would they lie

[7:44:51] <electric_gynecologist> BloodTrail
[7:44:59] <phadelocke> @Calubos43 If making millions is being taken advantage of sign me up
[7:45:14] <Bohners> @electric_gynecologist bot lol
[7:45:24] <cracker90006> @k0yer ninja in the last stream he did he said that tfue has to pay banks for his creator code (that‚Äôs what I remember idk what he exactly said tho)
[7:45:25] <bigmac420chitown> @electric_gynecologist later
[7:45:27] <K0YER> @pixyyyy Why wouldn‚Äôt they lie? Lmao 60k is not nothing. And that‚Äôs just what they said I wouldn‚Äôt believe everything
[7:45:30] <Izaslayer> Turner and ninja start their own org lol
[7:45:36] <DoyLy> sponsors
[7:45:38] <cyberspectra> @pixyyyy Only 60k from a person that makes millions? That seems fishy
[7:45:39] <Hi_iTzAlex> @pixyyyy 60K they already have taken. Tfue might owe a lot of money to faze
[7:45:42] <phadelocke> @pixyyyy I dont think they lied because that shit can bite them in the ass in court
[7:45:43] <Bohners> faze < tfue......peen gang for life
[7:45:45] <numiockk> cali laws are scary faze could be gone

[7:46:05] <Jeffiee> It was 2 brand deals
[7:46:18] <landondiess> Gold infantry
[7:46:19] <pistolmaravich> @kingrichard id assume most of the money they earned from tfue comes from using him as a selling point to a sponsor
[7:46:20] <phadelocke> @jordyrios7 He already used Faze, he dont need them no more thats why he wants to get out of his contract
[7:46:27] <Bohners> ohhhh
[7:46:32] <AsphyxiationQueen> ?????????????
[7:46:33] <jamesyh555> The thing is Tfue‚Äôs lawyers statement talks about branding and sponsorship and that‚Äôs the part that faze ignored in their statement

[7:47:16] <hog_squeezer69> yep, they'd be the worst clan managers ever if they only made 60k with tfue
[7:47:22] <phadelocke> @KingRichard Do you think that info (minutes watched) and details of contracts being signed will ever be released to the public like sport athletes?
[7:47:27] <lrb_yoshi> Zone
[7:47:33] <Bohners> tsm has like 5 ads every 15 mins lol

[7:47:51] <K0YER> They definitely got more than 60k with tfue that‚Äôs pure bull if you ask me
[7:47:52] <thatreally> It‚Äôs like a 360 deal in the music industry someone always gets finessed

[7:48:54] <cracker90006> If this is true which it could be I hope for wonderful futures Tfue will have on his career
[7:48:56] <0subtrain> Cloak released a statement, kinda vague tho @izaslayer
[7:48:56] <hog_squeezer69> faze definitely needs a pro PR manager :D
[7:48:59] <pixyyyy> Yea this is so Fresh we cant really put opinions out there cause not enough info
[7:49:01] <pistolmaravich> cloak already said they are still partners

[7:49:36] <K0YER> @randy99s That‚Äôs dam near impossible
[7:49:39] <jicktor> Hey guys can someone tell me if its normal
[7:49:46] <numiockk> Banks fked up everything to be honest the first all he had to do was to get a PR why would he go public LUL
[7:49:52] <pistolmaravich> if we get fortnite friday out of this thou its a win for all of us LUL
[7:49:53] <phadelocke> Tomorrow's headline "King Richard starts a sports Org"
[7:49:56] <CasketExpress> Tfue just doesn‚Äôt want all his millions to be yoinked like kills on fortnite from a 3rd party
[7:50:01] <Izaslayer> yeah if we make a mill together you da home for life
[7:50:02] <K0YER> You can only end a big career if you just stop doing what your doing tbh
[7:50:11] <almightygod4> @pistolmaravich It's confirmed happening
[7:50:11] <SimplyS4> tat was not worth going for LUL
[7:50:13] <SimplyS4> that*
[7:50:19] <jamesyh555> @numiockk someone needs to change his twitter password for sure lmao
[7:50:19] <0subtrain> It‚Äôs not about hate between orgs or players it‚Äôs about the player (tfue) getting a fair amount of the money that he essentially creates for the game and for the org. Same shit is going on with nfl players, it‚Äôs just more transparent
[7:50:21] <randy99s> @K0YER after watching banks video you'll understand buddy
[7:50:22] <cyberspectra> All I know is I like watching tsue not faze clan, and I‚Äôm not going to jump on a bandwagon. I might now actually know tfue but I know him a whole lot more than faze clan.
[7:50:23] <Im__Vixxy> How excited are you about Fortnite Friday‚Äôs coming back? @kingrichard
[7:50:32] <tastymitch> you quit Apax bro?

[7:51:24] <pistolmaravich> @jamesyh555 that‚Äôs the irony off it all
[7:51:25] <K0YER> @randy99s I‚Äôve watched banks video and it‚Äôs stupid tbh and he‚Äôs prob just doing it for clout. Tfue is more popular than banks now anyways. Career is definitely not over they said the same thing bout ninja

[7:55:27] <CasketExpress> I feel for Tfue. He already said he hated LA. But I would bet a pretty penny that the beach house he grew up in, is a lot more chill and enjoyable than the mansion living with the nelkboys next to the brazzers pornstar mansion down the street from the clout house where vitaly comes and drops off his pet goats whenever he feels like it.

[8:09:22] <Qwickzzz> tfue made a mistake he is gonna lose a lot from this
[8:09:25] <Bohners> tfue doesnt want faze to have any of his wc money corrina said

[8:10:06] <sauceboythe_jman> @KeDaQu right! he shouldve been more careful when he 1st signed it
[8:10:07] <EatMiLumpia> We thoomin King? TriHard
[8:10:09] <K0YER> Ranked is stupid after a certain point
[8:10:16] <Qwickzzz> no u are fdor not realizing that faze did the right thing
[8:10:16] <Bohners> nrg is best
[8:10:20] <Omnipotant> @K0YER 60k is a very reasonable number to have made off of him. i completely believe that number. Again, theres no way he only kept 20%. If that was the case, cloak would have a fucked up contract too, being that cloak was signed first. 72hrs also left FaZe and had no contract issues.
[8:10:23] <CasketExpress> @kedaqu he signed it because he was a streamer who averaged 100 views on his stream. He didn‚Äôt care about the money he wanted to play. Now he‚Äôs making millions, and 80% of a million is ALOT of money. He wants OUT of that contract so they don‚Äôt take his shit. Why tf would anyone want that
[8:10:25] <DoyLy> mixer is actually pretty big now according the stats they got over 30 million views last month.. twitch got 856 million,, not nearly as big but still big

[8:10:56] <benjbreadon> FaZedown
[8:11:08] <sauceboythe_jman> tfue shouldve been more careful when he 1st signed it because if any1 can just get out of a contract then whats the point of contracts
[8:11:10] <K0YER> Who‚Äôs a big mixer streamer?
[8:11:11] <jamesyh555> @k0yer yuup
[8:11:22] <thesquirrellounge> i hope tfue gets herpes
[8:11:28] <rumthroat> What do u think about this whole tfue situation
[8:11:30] <Bohners> i want tfue to join luminosity
[8:11:30] <phadelocke> @sauceboythe_jman Agreed
[8:11:31] <Qwickzzz> guys watch faze bank reponse
[8:11:33] <Bohners> ninjaCRINJA
[8:11:44] <CasketExpress> What Tfue did was necessary to get out of his contract in order to get what he wanted. Or else he‚Äôd be stuck for the next 3 years. Having FaZe Banks and all of the clan do whatever they wanted with his money. He boomed to what he is now in less than a year. 3 years is a lot of time.
[8:12:02] <KeDaQu> @CasketExpress Suing is not the same as wanting out. Suing is saying they did something wrong. They didn't unless they didn't tell him they'd take 80%.
[8:12:02] <K0YER> Big streamers don‚Äôt need orgs fyi
[8:12:09] <phadelocke> @sauceboythe_jman Or there has to be some cancellation clause where they will be charged some sort of early cancellation fee , be a fixed amount or %, its what we do in our business in rl
[8:12:10] <CasketExpress> Y‚Äôall trippin if you think Tfue is in the wrong

[8:18:45] <sauceboythe_jman> that was tough
[8:18:48] <0subtrain> I agree @qwickzzz but fortnite/esports/BR games are so content focused that the player has to go out there and put out/achieve. Faze is only the platform but tfue is the content
[8:18:52] <nihalwarring> bye youtube:(
[8:18:59] <Bohners> kr does ur org care what you play? bc eso doesnt bring many view do they hate that ?

[8:22:43] <0subtrain> @qwickzzz they took a chance on a Young skilled BR player and it paid off and tfue grew more than anyone could have possibly anticipated.
