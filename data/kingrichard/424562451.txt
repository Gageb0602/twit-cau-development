[1:14:54] <silentdagger64> season 10 is going to vault the scar bc fortnite wants to keep the trend of vaulting og guns
[1:15:25] <chief2bongs> kingrichChair kingrichPotato
[1:15:28] <SimplyS4> the season only just started
[1:15:35] <SimplyS4> they make many changes as the season goes on
[1:15:49] <SimplyS4> we'll see what they have instore
[1:16:20] <CasketExpress> Hopefully a new shotgun
[1:16:22] <chief2bongs> they vaulted thermal pump balloons etc for more shield in loot pool
[1:16:24] <CasketExpress> And no drumgun
[1:16:28] <CasketExpress> LUL LUL
[1:16:28] <Ezzahh> exactly
[1:16:34] <silentdagger64> i hope fortnite makes better changes bc the gameplay has gone downhill since the drum gun came back
[1:16:39] <SimplyS4> well people speculating the heavy shotty is coming back

[1:17:02] <athugspassion> Are you gonna start back being competitive
[1:17:09] <chief2bongs> bot *
[1:17:13] <Buddhakhris> the heavy shotty will save season 9
[1:17:18] <Lapp_> They need to bring back pre nerf guided missile no kap
[1:17:24] <SwizzPrime> chat whats better combat or tac shotty?
[1:17:28] <silentdagger64> yeah, the heavy will replace the combat but not same as pump, can I get an F for the pump
[1:17:36] <SwizzPrime> i like playing aggressive soo
[1:17:37] <CasketExpress> I like the new shotgun I just miss being able to one shot people BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump

[1:17:49] <SimplyS4> tac does more dmg but combat better range
[1:17:50] <chief2bongs> unvault season 3 meteors symfHypers symfHypers symfHypers symfHypers symfHypers symfHypers
[1:17:50] <SwizzPrime> @CasketExpress SAMEE
[1:17:59] <SimplyS4> so its pretty much preference
[1:18:24] <SwizzPrime> @SimplyS4 i feel like i do more damage with the combat
[1:18:32] <Buddhakhris> unvault moisty mire
[1:18:43] <chief2bongs> combat has higher damage per second

[1:18:51] <CasketExpress> A shotgun is pointless to carry if you can‚Äôt shoot someone point blank in the face and kill them imo

[1:19:07] <Nightbot> Logitech G305
[1:19:21] <SwizzPrime> Casket i completely agree with you
[1:19:28] <silentdagger64> the only thing fortnite will unvault is bugs BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack
[1:19:42] <Buddhakhris> imho the combat is like a short range pistol
[1:19:49] <SimplyS4> @CasketExpress not necessarily
[1:19:50] <CasketExpress> But I do indeed enjoy the new shotgun. It is pretty cool
[1:19:53] <Nightbot> Follow KR on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KingRichard
[1:19:57] <CasketExpress> I like the fire rate
[1:20:09] <SimplyS4> building is why shotgun have a huge factor in this game
[1:20:11] <silentdagger64> shot guns don't act like shotguns in fortnite
[1:20:25] <SwizzPrime> @CasketExpress especially since they fixed it with the dmg count now

[1:21:48] <chief2bongs> KR was talking about how most fights end in pump shotguns what's wrong with switching up the monotonous symfHypers
[1:21:49] <CasketExpress> I think they should add a KSG type shotty. That would be dope
[1:22:10] <groovyat> Easy dubs comiButt
[1:22:13] <wezzz222> Hey
[1:22:17] <OMGitSalty> hey @KingRichard
[1:22:35] <supremesteve716> did he stop playing xpex?
[1:22:38] <Brett6060> @casketexpress best thing I've heard today that would be great I used to love the ksg
[1:22:41] <OMGitSalty> @KingRichard can we play together?
[1:22:46] <chief2bongs> they need to focus on making the game run smoothly and a good shield spawn rate
[1:22:48] <CasketExpress> That‚Äôs what I like most about fortnite. It‚Äôs always changing
[1:23:14] <groovyat> I never get shield when I play, it‚Äôs so annoying
[1:23:21] <Buddhakhris> minis!
[1:23:31] <OMGitSalty> @KingRichard can we play together?
[1:23:33] <SwizzPrime> gg good try
[1:23:38] <SimplyS4> almost 4 am here but i aint tired NotLikeThis
[1:23:41] <CasketExpress> Need moar shields
[1:23:46] <groovyat> Good tru
[1:23:47] <silentdagger64> always changing is a good casual game but not competitive game,
[1:23:47] <chief2bongs> @groovyat it's already getting better this season
[1:23:54] <wezzz222> Dang gg
[1:24:08] <wezzz222> You hate to see it chat
[1:24:16] <SimplyS4> theres a whole lotta shield this season
[1:24:25] <Buddhakhris> ugh
[1:24:26] <SimplyS4> after they vaulted all those useless items
[1:24:27] <groovyat> @chief2bongs ESPECIALLY without the pump LUL

[1:27:16] <chief2bongs> @gmunplayz it's good unless the servers are overloaded

[1:28:18] <FearMyPumpp> ‚ÄúOr the new meta‚Äù
[1:28:18] <silentdagger64> @chief2bongs when you change any little detail in a competitive game it will completely change which is good every once in a while but fortnite completely took put the most used gun in fortnite out during some qualifiers, they put in season 9 and completely change the map, I have seen clips of people lose qualifiers too bc of strip streams, if fortnite constantly changes the game there will be no time to adapt

[3:12:12] <Gary_Glitshow> yesss fortnite
[3:12:24] <king_yamii> the walking dead was absolutely a great show the first three seasons
[3:12:24] <tchungus15> did he wuit apex?
[3:12:29] <octanemain> I cant go back to fortnite gunplay
[3:12:30] <tchungus15> quit*
[3:12:41] <spencw> fortnite competitive is trash. but as a casual game its one of the best games of all time
[3:12:47] <TheyCallMee_Q> Lol he should apex dead af
[3:12:47] <iloveallwoman> yes even 4 seasons, then....
[3:12:56] <tchungus15> agreed

[3:14:02] <YungForGe> once they left the prison on walking dead it was dookie
[3:14:02] <tchungus15> i mean if epic would stop updating fright before world cup qualifiers it might be okay
[3:14:03] <xthe_1_the_onlyx> @spencw yeah but you can barely play casual without running into a minimum of 3 ttv/yt tryhards
[3:14:17] <king_yamii> the guy he's playing with is a streamer?
[3:14:17] <tchungus15> right*

[3:30:16] <d_shmunny> so tac is considered better than the new pump? havent been playing fortnite recently
[3:30:47] <YungForGe> @d_shmunny blue tac wayy more reliable
[3:30:53] <nottimmy44> New pumps hits 100 plus from distance it is much better but harder to hit ur shots
[3:30:59] <YungForGe> and consistent
[3:30:59] <Yak_Attack_> The combats lowkey underrated
[3:31:10] <Yak_Attack_> @nottimmy44 Exactly
[3:31:13] <Telo4K> You can do it thru a window so your vulnerable
[3:31:30] <Yak_Attack_> @yungforge not really anymore. The buff kinda made it more consistent
[3:31:33] <nottimmy44> High ground plus combat shorty is kills and win

[3:58:26] <MischiefBot> Do you still play For Honor yo?
[3:58:28] <Yak_Attack_> @jlegit21 yeah. Honestly we hate to hear it but the game has actually been real balanced with this update. You can use any gun to fit your style of play
[3:58:36] <sinpetri> how old are you?
[3:58:36] <evidentLEE> back on the fortnite grind?
[3:58:56] <Yak_Attack_> People may like silenced smgs, some tac, some drum. Whatever suits you ü§∑üèæ‚ôÇÔ∏è
[3:58:58] <ChazGGaming> Unfortunately apex takes too long bring out new fresh content
[3:59:00] <evidentLEE> @KingRichard how you liking season 9?

[4:00:11] <juurrdd> its not even the lack of content chaz. Fortnite took a long time to steadily release content. apex needs to figure out their hacker situation and fix the many bugs in the game
[4:00:17] <sl3azyt> It‚Äôs suppose to be a Netflix for games.
[4:00:27] <juurrdd> they have no excuse to have such a small dev team with how much money they have made off it
[4:00:28] <jorisvdwoude> I am 22 today
[4:00:39] <kuyugo> what are your thoughts on people comparing PvP and First Person Shooter?
[4:00:43] <ChazGGaming> @juurrdd true say bud
[4:00:59] <youngblood12> You like to get kills with it but hate getting killed by it
[4:01:05] <jorisvdwoude> I am 22 today
[4:01:13] <dabthr> Why do you like the drum gun? You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unbalanced?
[4:01:34] <lonewolf032438> I'm 55 today
[4:01:35] <superbz2> We need pump to balance drum gun
[4:01:52] <baghearuh> Cody Kessler = the new Nick Foles
[4:02:02] <FunnyLookinWhat> Boss how has the night been goin?
[4:02:48] <kuyugo> drum gun is balanced. against a good player spraying will only get you a shotgun to the head
[4:03:09] <Staxbee> Damn you grinding longer and harder than tfue I honestly think you‚Äôre underrated
[4:03:10] <Yak_Attack_> @kuyugo I agree
[4:03:33] <superbz2> @kuyugo you can‚Äôt even 1 tap anymore so that‚Äôs not completely true
[4:03:44] <youngblood12> You don't even need a shotgun to win a game
[4:03:53] <juurrdd> @Wassabi333 i dont mind the graphics. its minimalistic and fun. i dont play fortnite personally because i dont like the playstyle with building and the gunplay
[4:03:58] <rilloxmoe> welcome back brother
[4:04:05] <clintonthebeat> goood to see you grinding this more

[4:33:33] <jayzook> why its so bright lmao
[4:33:34] <Swebb93> Da king Rich
[4:33:37] <diabetaz> theydid it cause 26% of all kills last season came from the pump
[4:33:38] <jayzook> hurt my eyes geez
[4:33:45] <CaLiKiLLiN> my games even on casual minimum 5 ballerS
[4:33:50] <menske018> do you want pump shottgun back
[4:33:52] <aj_97_> @4Salty u have no argument buddy
[4:33:56] <Lunacy4987> Best loadout 2 drumguns a flint and minis and some other healing or stinks or boogies
[4:34:04] <youngblood12> why he hatin so much over a game
[4:34:05] <antarbro> fortnite was fortnite since season 4
[4:34:13] <4Salty> @aj_97_ ok bud calm down
[4:34:17] <goldiesoulo> @oneshotrich nope, but I can see how that makes sense. that's when tommy gun was added and it became a spray meta
[4:34:23] <rilloxmoe> i bet drum gun will be over 50% of kills this season if not more
[4:34:23] <mrpatbud> I think its only for the holidays once the kids are back at school the pump should be back
[4:34:32] <antarbro> after that they trying to fuk it up
[4:34:47] <Freeza_2G> nah the pump spread was too wide just made it rng at least i know when i hit someone with this shotgun for 150 headshot its skill
[4:34:48] <aj_97_> @4Salty ok ur salty cause I'm telling the truth OkayChamp

[5:57:13] <xR1pT1dex> use a ramp when u try to take someones wall it protects ur back and allows you to keep height
[5:57:23] <insnet> can u please kill someone :S
[5:57:38] <Shadowx644> mods???!!
[5:57:45] <cuziikroom> Drum gun is the best

[5:58:01] <Balkaniko> thay suld remowe drum gun

[5:58:17] <Balkaniko> drum weapon for noobs only spam and get dmg
[5:58:25] <kosty42> Fortnite is nothing but drum gun spam now :/
[5:58:32] <fondcrayfish712> Drum gun is aids
[5:58:32] <FairyPrinz> ture
[5:58:37] <agkshane> nah, they should make drum gun gold and reuce the drop lrate like they did with the bow
[5:58:39] <Balkaniko> tactical and drum lol no skills only spam
[5:58:41] <Balkaniko> ez
[5:58:46] <agkshane> ez fix, they wont do that tho
[5:58:46] <Bohners> they need to get rid of build ramps...only build a wall for protection

[5:59:48] <agkshane> @fondcrayfish712 actually its what ive wanted since before they vaulted it. Ive always loved the drum gun, its way to common of a spawn tho
[5:59:56] <Balkaniko> and faster farming materials in normal games... maby shields and health when you kill someone
[5:59:56] <FairyPrinz> I have so many bug while Im gameing
[6:00:07] <FairyPrinz> they did not a good job this time
[6:00:13] <Balkaniko> ye seasson 9 iss soo baggy
[6:00:15] <kellenjkill> Why is he playing fortnite (i love fortnite) but why did he switch back
[6:00:29] <agkshane> take the blue drum, make it gold and ram the spawn rate into the ground, easy.
[6:00:33] <Bohners> ill watch but i will never go back to playin fort
[6:00:35] <Balkaniko> cuz he play fortnite like main game
[6:00:39] <Balkaniko> x)
[6:00:43] <Balkaniko> from seasson 1
[6:01:06] <fondcrayfish712> @agkshane then people who find it are at an insane disadvantage. Why not just vault it

[6:01:52] <FairyPrinz> season 1-3 must be awesome!
[6:01:58] <kosty42> 1-3 will always be the best fortnite
[6:02:07] <agkshane> By that logic any gold legendary weapon should be removed. Gold rpg, gone. Bow, gone. Gold heavy snipe, reloads way to fast, take it out
[6:02:12] <Bohners> We need a game that is mmo...br are stale now
[6:02:26] <fondcrayfish712> @agkshane exactly lol
[6:02:28] <Bohners> @fairyprinz best ever
[6:02:29] <kellenjkill> @agkshane they actually should all be removed though
[6:02:34] <Balkaniko> im playing since seasson 2 and i can say only that fortnite now and in first seassons 5-6 is totaly diffrent gamer
[6:02:36] <agkshane> the point of having a gold gun with a low drop rate is that it supposed to be a hype pick up that gives that player an advantage
[6:02:42] <FairyPrinz> I play animal royal :)
[6:03:13] <agkshane> the entire BR genre is based around rng, thats a mute point
[6:03:28] <FairyPrinz> so a good feeling

[6:04:13] <agkshane> the blue drum is strong enough to be considered a gold weapon.

[6:07:38] <agkshane> @fondcrayfish712 I agree, that being said at some point there has to be a balance. I'd consider myself better than average at fortnite, but not good enough to hold my own in the WC right? I still like the drum gun, all the pros hate it.
[6:07:45] <fondcrayfish712> @noobtroopert non competitive public matches (not arena or World Cup qualifiers) essentially casual play

[6:08:35] <agkshane> @fondcrayfish712 Thats why I said their goal should be to fix the dum gun but keep it in the game, which a vast majority of the casual community wants. Tfue and all these other pros will just cry and moan about the game, its annoying af. Reason 1 why I like watching king

[6:09:26] <fondcrayfish712> @agkshane I agree tfue and some pros complain too much but put yourself in their position. They‚Äôre making a living playing this game
[6:09:29] <kellenjkill> This game would be better if it had no cosmetics to buy and cost $25 to filter out the 7 year olds
[6:09:29] <kosty42> It‚Äôd be ok if it did less damage
[6:09:38] <agkshane> @fondcrayfish712 If epic wants to fix it by adding more playlists, seems fine to me. At some point that may get a bit convoluted tho you know?

[6:11:00] <noobtroopert> dont you think streamers would be epics main income, theyre the ones who buy all the skins and keep the hype up

[6:12:56] <GadgetManTY> @ramp_age117 you do love me üòçüò≠
[6:13:02] <big_rayyy90> They should nerf the heavy but keep breaking wall
[6:13:10] <FestiveTaco> @KingRichard Im sure youve been asked a lot, but how ya likin fortnite?
[6:13:11] <fondcrayfish712> There‚Äôs a certain level of RNG that needs to be present. Like @agkshane said there needs to be a healthy balance
[6:13:13] <GadgetManTY> @ramp_age117 gadget6FTH kingrichLove
[6:13:29] <Ramp_age117> Lol you know it @gadgetmanty
[6:13:40] <GadgetManTY> what's good @kingrichard how's the family
[6:14:03] <walawalafingdong> I'm really excited for this next game!!!
[6:14:05] <Tequila_Shots> the heavy is nerf'd its called reload time
[6:14:14] <agkshane> RNG is what makes BR fun right? like thats the entire point. as long as its balanced, and if not balanced they make efforts to reach balance then its fine.
[6:14:19] <ItzDezl> !subs
[6:14:25] <avasack> I love that some guns are over powered, makes the game more interesting. I do think spawn rate of drum gun needs to be lowered a bit, but RPG is already incredibly rare and rocket ammo rate is low. Boom bow I can‚Äôt stand but you have to be decent with it!

[6:14:46] <Nightbot> Join our partnered discord server now! https://discordapp.com/invite/ZUcEc8e
[6:15:04] <agkshane> My point is i feel when epic starts ripping guns in and ut of the game, changing core gameplay, changing playlists and modes, etc, the casual community wont want to keep up. And thats bad news for Fn
[6:15:05] <GadgetManTY> @ramp_age117 check your dm

[6:15:44] <youngledge> mongraal is the GOAT
[6:16:03] <fondcrayfish712> Then just change up pubs and add new games and items to those. Comp stays the same. Casuals satisfies and comp players too
[6:16:17] <Bohners> chap is playin stretch res
[6:16:20] <Bohners> ninjaTroll
[6:16:25] <avasack> Oh I so agree @agkshane I like getting comfortable with guns and having a fun load out that I like using all the time, but then they go and remove and add and add and remove, etc

[6:16:57] <agkshane> agreed, i myself dont have issues w health per kills being in comp and not pubs. my friends who are much more casual tho hate it, because it was introduced and then ripped out
[6:17:10] <GadgetManTY> Ty @ramp_age117
[6:17:20] <Ramp_age117> Ok
[6:17:25] <agkshane> That being said, if FN would just implement a consistent public test server they wouldnt screw themselves as much i feel haha
[6:17:27] <Bohners> i wonder how much they pay you per week being in a org
[6:17:39] <GadgetManTY> I almost forgot you get those all day @ramp
[6:17:47] <avasack> Yeah I‚Äôm ok with it now! Only thing I would like is for the farming rate to be buffed so trees and stuff give you as much as they do in competitive. But oh well! I enjoy it nonetheless

[6:18:42] <agkshane> @avasack Yeah thats my point. I like how fortnite is able to introduce new changes and change up metas. But if they get used to making very large changes regularly the casual players wont want to keep up with it you know?
[6:18:53] <cryptic_liii> Just got hit with 3 ads sheesh

[6:21:04] <cheif_bluntz> Epic games is good at making games and then ruining it, like gears of war
[6:21:04] <Bohners> 26
[6:21:07] <agkshane> @avasack Yeah thats a great way to put it. Which goes back to my original point of, yea, the drum gun is crazy op. so if they just make it gold and drop the spawn rate of it significantly to the point where when you pull a gold drum gun you get that same feeling of getting a gold rpg back in season 2. its strong, but its rare af. Everyone wins, per say

[6:21:54] <avasack> @agkshane absolutely! That‚Äôs why I like the heavy sniper too because it‚Äôs super rare and really satisfying when you get it because of rarity. Totally agree
[6:21:55] <chief2bongs> outplayed kingrichDF
[6:21:59] <Basherkid86> removes pump for 25% of kills... but allows drum gun which has to be like 50% or more at this point.

[6:39:47] <QUEENxyZEE> Power is better than 100 but both good
[6:39:50] <cheif_bluntz> Back in season 2, I felt like epic really understood the community when I saw the backpackkidd dance emote and the Carlton dance emote but then they ignored everything the community wanted. In the social media generation how can they not listen to their fanbase. Their priority must be making money because it isn‚Äôt making a good game anymore
[6:39:57] <avasack> The 100 seemed super cheesy in the first episode, does that stop?
[6:39:59] <QUEENxyZEE> @gadgetmanty Yesss, been finish.
[6:40:02] <NineInchNickk> @NidNeutrino its just so funny and wholesome, makes you cry till you cant breathe, makes you cry, i havent found another comedy that even comes close
