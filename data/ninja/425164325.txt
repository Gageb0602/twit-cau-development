[0:50:22] <Ryksen> Its so tragic LULW
[0:50:24] <alexstewart4> An IP ban is okay but you can pretty easily change your IP by contacting your ISP. They need to do a HID ban and ban the kids mobo/processor signature. Make him buy a new pc every time.
[0:50:28] <MTKLive> he might be older than 18 who knows
[0:50:30] <m0hannad> but those skins were old skins, does he have multiple accounts??

[1:17:36] <Figjam300> Only concern with drum gun is ammo conservation if you are carrying an AR too. But medium ammo is pretty easy to find.

[1:18:01] <Droskiezz> The new gun is an SMG cause it takes small ammo right?

[1:18:28] <BradyBoy1367> Droskiezz ppl say that epic shouldnt have given them the option, but i really dont like that mentality because the drum gun was one of the major things that ppl had been asking for back for a while. wouldnt have made sense if they didnt include it as an option

[1:19:50] <mparkex> Did you see the clip of Myth just W Keying people with the drum during WC qualifiers? It was so dumb @Ninja
[1:19:51] <berserk_850> Why the pump WHY WHY
[1:19:57] <imadambomb10> @Daredevil_RL True and now its even less risky cause shottys do less damage. plus drum makes it easier to spray
[1:19:59] <BarbxLahey> ya johnny
[1:19:59] <BradyBoy1367> BeeMcG drum gun nerf, p90 vault, fixing the slip streams, and a lot of good communication is what makes it a really good patch

[1:20:03] <Twitzh> Whaaaaaaaat most babies is hella ugly LUL @mishilO
[1:20:03] <Buhdzy> I think the pump had too much headshot damage but other than that it was fine
[1:20:10] <JungleManGeorge98> and most of the time people would tag them up with an smg or ar before finishing them off with a pump
[1:20:12] <Kemli> *slides over extra cushions for Twitzh*
[1:20:15] <Spyderr> I think it's kind of refreshing, at least in pubs, to not have the pump. Battles vary a lot more. It's not just edit/pump/build/edit/pump repeat.
[1:20:19] <bbkellerdabz92> Just playing duos
[1:20:20] <Figjam300> They said 26% of kills were from pumps. I mean, it is a finishing weapon. That or pump then switch to smg.
[1:20:21] <ItsAntonMan92> EPIC trying to give pro players to spend more time learning a new meta and as the result of that, they are developing Fortnite PTSD lol

[1:21:50] <BarbxLahey> LULW @Spyderr i feel bad for laughing
[1:21:51] <Yetas> totally agree @Ninja , and i feel 26% was not much, its 1/5 of the kills, shared with assault rifles, snipers, pistols, rockets. I mean, people used the pump over the tac for obvious reasons, if the tac were better it would be different
[1:21:53] <dylpicklezzz> 45 headshot damage is still too high

[1:22:06] <BradyBoy1367> Spyderr LUL it was depressing to see that only me and one other guy were voting tac smg LUL
[1:22:08] <LoRswat> would a 50 clip down to a 30 clip make a difference for you in the drum gun?
[1:22:08] <b0ngs04> nerf BTW LUL
[1:22:09] <Daredevil_RL> it just means you die .1 second slower to the drum gun LUL
[1:22:09] <ItsAntonMan92> they only nerfed ithe tommy gun what 5 damage less?

[1:22:11] <MagneticXDYT> @Yetas it's 1/4 ;p;
[1:22:11] <WithThe420MonthResub> the rate of fire and recoil is the problem
[1:22:12] <vintageszn> the people that voted for the drum gun where the kids in 5th grade that thought the gun looked cool
[1:22:13] <Spyderr> @barbxlahey LUL I laughed too and I'm his dad.. so you're good. He was soo let down. I felt bad.

[1:22:57] <BradyBoy1367> mishilO am i missing something? dont know how that would make the drum more viable
[1:22:59] <viral_jerms> Dude that‚Äôs on point
[1:23:03] <camry_gang> Drumguns best counter was the pump and when the pump was at a reliable spot for awhile they vaulted it
[1:23:06] <Ryksen> LULW
[1:23:07] <mishilO> @johnny_mack96 the only bad thing about the drum gun was the range and how many bullets it uses so the new assault rifle fixed that LULW

[1:28:26] <TSGG_ANiME> Tommy gun supposed to be like an smg which means same damage as an smg not more, like a mini gun! In it needs to be patched and damage needs to be lower than what it is now. Or best they need to vaulted and bring tac smg back because it was much better
[1:28:28] <fondcrayfish712> If your ping is over 40 drum gun will rip through turbo builds

[1:30:52] <BradyBoy1367> gravityxi_ the overall goal was to make the majority of the community happier by bringing back their favorite gun, so they included it and since the drum gun was brought back and won by a landslide i think that a lot of the ppl that voted for it are happy lol

[2:13:18] <ryanpete10> @gravityxi_ @Sammy_Sweed see my understanding was that they knew it was a POWER plant but didnt know it was NUCLEAR power. that's kinda what i was gathering from their meeting in the bunker but i'm gonna look more into it
[2:13:22] <mooon2x> I ALWAYS get sniped by teams like this

[2:14:13] <PraiseTreesus> It's kind of difficult to hide whether a plant is nuclear or conventional. There are very obvious differences in construction

[3:25:05] <johnny_mack96> ninjaFail how tf are they rushing things. I don‚Äôt get you people
[3:25:12] <th3b3st52> people are overreacting on the new season. Sure its not as good as before but its still a good tv show. There is layers to the storylines and i like how everytnig has panned out. Just didnt hit as hard as other seasons.
[3:25:13] <Da_bOSS> LUL @BlueBull714
[3:25:13] <Wheels03> I can see why people wouldn't like this season, but to see it getting flamed as hard as it is, it's sad to see. I guarantee GoT will still be revered as a great show once the dust settles
[3:25:15] <ienstein> make more episodes

[4:26:49] <MeatStickTV> @williambrodersen12 ya I know, controller needs it but honestly I started on PC and bought a controller to try it and actually building isn't as hard to learn on controller, no having to reset mouse position the hardest thing I feel about controller is the fact of having to switch mode, everything else honestly seems just as easy
