[1:08:56] <LesClaypool> 2% isnt lazy?
[1:09:12] <Law_of_Thirds> His warding is lazy
[1:09:26] <whiteindiandood> its not that they dont listen its voys shotcalling is too high iq for them to even understand mooT
[1:09:29] <r10senpai> Type just the necessary
[1:09:36] <PhiINye> Triple Mountain
[1:09:38] <tbonesmoove> No call is bad Voy its the teams Execution

[1:09:39] <r10senpai> EZ
[1:09:40] <PhiINye> wow
[1:09:41] <VandesGrants> yeah im not trying to say you make a lot of bad ones, you're right everyone makes a bad one occasionally
[1:09:45] <tbonesmoove> they arent on your level
[1:09:55] <TheGreenDeke> He has overlay.... you can't even see vision so why would you talk about buying wards
[1:10:25] <joeschmogamer> akali and sneaky are going to be a pain to pin down
[1:10:36] <metralletajose> Why not conqueror?
[1:10:42] <H1de0nKu5h> Fun fact: Voy's favorite call is Mountain drake. the more you know SeemsGood
[1:10:47] <whiteindiandood> pinning down sneaky Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:11:08] <rMcGuire23> did they not hotfix mura on kaisa?
[1:11:08] <jpl315> I learned from Voy that mountain priority is above nexus.

[1:11:18] <joeschmogamer> @whiteindiandood voyGASM voyGASM voyGASM
[1:11:25] <unqualifiedtolive> why does kaisa build muramane now?
[1:11:27] <PhiINye> If I had to guess, it's because he values the ability to counteract Glacial Augment in lane against Ahri with FF, and there aren't a lot of tanks on the enemy team to justify conq
[1:11:49] <tbonesmoove> Nautilus LUL
[1:11:56] <TheGreenDeke> Didnt have to remove overlay Voy, was just commenting chat can't even see vision so telling you to get wards or not doesnt make sense
[1:11:57] <scpoder> some korean dude did it on kaisa
[1:12:01] <hunter2130> hi
[1:12:03] <Tiddlywinks69> @unqualifiedtolive allows you to get 3 q evolves with muramana guinsoos and nashors
[1:12:10] <scpoder> and it was kinda good
[1:12:11] <unqualifiedtolive> ah
[1:12:19] <Tiddlywinks69> @unqualifiedtolive more raw ad than just stormrazor too for a harder spike once q is evolved

[1:12:43] <arenaman> Does guinsoos proc double muramana
[1:12:52] <VandesGrants> yes
[1:12:57] <scpoder> you go nashoor with this build
[1:13:04] <scpoder> you go ap after your rageblade

[4:28:18] <Numbah214> GG BOYS
[4:28:22] <Swatri> rosty?
[4:28:24] <alwayslacking> but they apparently introduced the plates as that mechanic but similarly to stop the hardstomp snow ball
[4:28:26] <reyrodq8> kass with rod
[4:28:39] <Numbah214> 7/1 kass "maybe they'll throw"
[4:28:43] <reyrodq8> he can 1v9 even if they thorw
[4:28:43] <CowOnCocaine> kaisa is kass's daughter?
[4:28:50] <scpoder> yes
[4:28:53] <mdc5000> Plates just adds free gold for the team that is already winning
[4:29:08] <Numbah214> @mdc5000 it really does
[4:29:10] <mizamar> frozen mallet azir tech incoming Pog?
[4:29:16] <chrisrox22> @alwayslacking drafting winning lanes is way more important now
[4:29:28] <Keyll> thats the whole point of plates, they didnt want lane to be a snoozefest

[4:29:46] <townofsalep> @mdc5000 i think it is a good thing because you can really win this way. Before plates even if you win lanes etc. it doesnt feel like winning
