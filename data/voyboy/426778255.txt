[0:48:49] <PlatypusPwnYou> how does sylas use kaisa R if he cant apply plasma?
[0:49:00] <hindxsight> literally every sylas player maxes W first its where most of sylas power is and your just missing out with lvl1 w at 20mins
[0:49:17] <gone__rogue> @PlatypusPwnYou cc applies a plasma stack
[0:49:21] <limsyy365> Hey chat
[0:49:22] <feedmena> @AnalAcrobat55 it just lets use her jump in the air thing
[0:49:27] <shuckhax123> @hindxsight most sylas are q max now, giving wave clear
[0:49:32] <Rohbby> why does syalus have such an insane kit
[0:49:42] <Rohbby> hes basically ap riven
[0:49:48] <AkimboPower> Clap
[0:49:50] <AnalAcrobat55> @feedmena does it rappel off the R or do you have to push R then E?
[0:49:55] <firelordozai6741> Q,3pointse, w
[0:49:58] <hindxsight> your passive is free waveclear along with protobelt
[0:50:10] <feedmena> @AnalAcrobat55 just off the r
[0:50:11] <PlatypusPwnYou> @hindxsight check op.gg, W max is only 2.4% pickrate. Its all about Q>E>W now
[0:50:11] <hindxsight> w max is strongest to carry
[0:50:15] <xpennyroyalteax> gg
[0:50:19] <000guitarman> kaisa 🤔
[0:50:22] <DontStealMyOranges> @hindxsight why does champion.gg have Q max if "literally every sylas player maxes w"
[0:50:26] <BumAlmighty> wtf u get urstats @hindxsight
[0:50:31] <Beardoso> vayne had no ballz
[0:50:36] <hindxsight> use lol esports stats
[0:50:39] <hindxsight> faker max w
[0:50:40] <shuckhax123> in the past everyone was doing w max to be fair
[0:50:42] <hindxsight> all pro max w
[0:50:42] <1jamir0quai1> @hindxsight no it isnt, because it got nerfed to deaths, its useless to max
[0:50:47] <aloien> @hindxsight lolesports is not soloq
[0:50:53] <shuckhax123> its game dependant but q is most consistent
[0:50:55] <BumAlmighty> did u know w was nerfd
[0:50:58] <minilongshot> Pepega it's what the pros do so that must be the only answer
[0:51:00] <dwangomang0> Voyboy with a meta build WutFace
[0:51:04] <1jamir0quai1> @hindxsight pls stop trashtalking, nobody is maxing it
[0:51:08] <StrayCrow> if you do the math you can see e max gives you more shields than the healing you get lol + 2 dashes lower cd = more passive proc
[0:51:11] <DontStealMyOranges> Faker did it Pepega
[0:51:19] <TheConstantHope> most people max Q - E - W on sylas
[0:51:19] <AngraBoiyu> people stopped maxing w after nerfs i think
[0:51:32] <minilongshot> Pepega don't ever adapt just blindly follow Faker
[0:51:37] <sweeperu> do whatever you want so does the boy

No one will ever dare to call NA a wildcard region again. It's not just C9 anymore, the gap is closed. 8 years of being memed as a 4fun region, 8 years of people laughing at Doublelift being an international choker, enough is enough. We poked this monster too much, it finally got pissed, woke up, and it's fucking hungry.

[5:06:12] <BySnakePrime> Ez is ez
[5:06:12] <EmpatheticRock> There is not a food that is harder to burn off than others. Calories are calories
