[0:58:33] <SpaceAidz> teezy219 spaceaYAYA
[0:58:35] <ZanzibarTwitch> Blue is good sometimes. Red is good all the time. So there's not really a reason to pick blue
[0:58:38] <innocentnoon> red is better against tank teams (sejuani)

[0:59:14] <Nikopol5> D:
[0:59:17] <siciliacaroline> @sam___easton sylas actually cant steal another sylas ult
[0:59:20] <akshat27596> @volcan198 no he goes blue cos hes smurfing in bronze and silver rn LUL
[0:59:23] <chadsaladsdad> @eigol I’m a robot I don’t understand sarcasm
[0:59:25] <volcan198> @ZanzibarTwitch blue burst damage is insane though, thats the main reason to go blue over red in situations
[0:59:27] <H1de0nKu5h> you can never go wrong with Red bc of the sustain, tankiness, and cc, you can def go wrong with blue
[0:59:42] <volcan198> @akshat27596 yee but he said on stream he finds it more fun anyways
[0:59:45] <thegreymattered> zven LUL
[0:59:45] <chadsaladsdad> Blue is more fun :)
[0:59:50] <sam___easton> @siciliacaroline let a loser dream, why u gotta kick me when im down dude
[0:59:53] <Buddy4089> @sam___easton you can’t steal his ult but if he stole someone on your teams ult you can have 2 of the same ult from your team
[1:00:03] <blackparatrooper> open Pepega
[1:00:04] <Eigol> staying in fights is more fun usually
[1:00:22] <siciliacaroline> @sam___easton on the bright side a sylas can steal a sylas ult if the second sylas has stolen someone else's ult?
[1:00:23] <volcan198> why would u need to stay in a fight if u can oneshot everyone :)
[1:00:26] <chadsaladsdad> @eigol killing everyone before the fight starts :)
[1:00:27] <sam___easton> @Buddy4089 ahh cool, i only play ranked so never seen the interaction
[1:00:28] <severagetm> How do people get to GM with this mentality LUL
[1:00:28] <Eigol> when you have vayne, neeko, sylas... "GaMe Is OvEr"

[3:03:34] <rcrcr> The research Voyboy is undergoing is only possible if one has greater than or equal to 4,566 iq. The ever constant gray screen we see teaches the importance of failure and how to improve from it. The games he plays are strictly for educational purposes which in turn results in us seeing games lost. we must appreciate the beauty of winning and losing just as we do the balance of yin and yang.

[7:19:55] <Banemann3> cya voy, have a nice fligth!
[7:19:57] <Scorba89> @Voyboy Master and above tiers decay work differently with a game banking system. Playing games adds towards the player's "banked games", up to a maximum of 10 games. 1 game is removed from the bank per day, and when the bank reaches 0, the player loses 250 LP per day until they bank more games.
[7:20:00] <yacrawdad> enjoy your trip
