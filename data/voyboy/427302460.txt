[2:32:13] <trickydickey> @fnatic_caps I dont think it triggered as many people as you think. G2 was already clearly better than TL so it wasn't very surprising
[2:32:13] <Receptorz> @benpie_the_senpai blocked btw

[2:32:19] <benpie_the_senpai> @Receptorz I played this game for the first 7 years. I think i have a better understanding of this game than you do.
[2:32:20] <MNAZerk> @fnatic_caps but no, why would i be mad? i am upset at TL's performance, especially from top and bot lane, but doubelift has pretty much become a liability with all his trash talk and very little show.

[2:33:37] <trickydickey> @MNAZerk question for you since, you seem to know what you're talking about lol
[2:33:41] <somekindofgoth> honestly i always felt like people who are so sure of themselves would be pretty humble when they win, because its what they expect. eu fanboys have been pretty rabid since they won, making me think they were pretty unsure of what they expected in the first place
[2:34:13] <MNAZerk> @fnatic_caps very intelligent to tilt TL by focusing on doublelift. so many games in the tourney bot wasnt hot like it was. great coaching and tempo decision.
[2:34:22] <WokenightStream> @somekindofgoth Imagine caring about eu fanboys enough to type that
[2:34:24] <YuYuYuna_> @somekindofgoth They have to make up somehow for worlds moon2S
[2:34:24] <DodgeballGaming> @somekindofgoth I like that thought dude. Very philosophical
[2:34:25] <xDSylveon> it's just na EU banter anyone that gets offended is too soft
[2:34:28] <Greyfc> @Voyboy Im wondering why i havent seen you play much of Sylas when you were so in love with him at release
[2:34:35] <trickydickey> @MNAZerk do you think lcs as a whole is better than lec as a whole or no? Obviously G2 is way better than the best team in NA (whether that be TL or not) but as a whole

[2:35:30] <skinnywhiteandgorgeouss> NA > EU
[2:35:32] <DodgeballGaming> @xdsylveon it’s not that I’m offended but more annoyed. I’d be annoyed if an NA person was doing it too. Just watch voy play and enjoy. That’s what it should be
[2:35:37] <GelsonFeigan> did TSM win MSI?
[2:35:39] <toocool4youdude> Voyboy as you q ecexute a minion press e on the minion to set up a stun, they cant see the animation quickly
[2:35:50] <spookskellyman> Everyone talking shit about NA vs EU but some asian team is just going to smash both at worlds anyways
[2:35:52] <MNAZerk> @trickydickey i havent watched enough of this season to make that determination. ive just been playing since beta so i have a coach's eye, but since my mouse quit i cant play league cause it's so damn inaccurate.
[2:35:56] <Greyfc> @Voyboy Wouldve thought you would add sylas into your champ pool
[2:35:56] <akshat27596> TSM WONNERED POGGERS

[2:36:06] <deadpool4969> I think we need more foreign players on are team if we want to get farther lol
[2:36:12] <trickydickey> @isaactangg hmm I can buy that honestly. I'm still not 100% convinced that TL is the best na team
[2:36:13] <JoonBoom> EU > NA = KR > CN :)
[2:36:15] <somekindofgoth> @oguzhanox but 90% of eu vs na "memes" are by eu? of course there were people on both sides but i mean look at them now they're just beating a dead horse over and over when it's not even interesting anymore lmao

[2:38:51] <DodgeballGaming> @isaactangg I mean we went to semis in world and went to finals. We aren’t weak. Not the strongest but not weak
[2:38:53] <somekindofgoth> @oguzhanox yeah tbh everyone in na knows we're a joke of a region, pretty sure a lot more people would just be happy about the fact that we won something, rather than because we "finally shut eu up". rn its just a little cringey because anyone with a brain always knew that eu was better than na
[2:38:55] <MNAZerk> @trickydickey it's rough cause the cheap asian gaming replacement mice have worked stellar in the past and this one is just terrible, can barely play shooters with it

[2:41:15] <MNAZerk> but polling rate could play a huge factor in it. higher polling rates eliminate errors caused by acceleration from jerky movements. low polling rates cant handle that

[2:43:01] <MNAZerk> @somekindofgoth yep pretty much always. i cant imagine the polling rate puts much stress on the cpu tho even with a high one. it's just a peripheral not software or something

[2:50:59] <somekindofgoth> @trickydickey the only reason she isn't pick or ban in soloq is because she's heavily skill gated. but that doesnt stop her from being really strong in average hands, just not as unstoppable as when she's played by really good players

[2:52:45] <somekindofgoth> @trickydickey yeah and it feels like in higher elo she's still pretty much in every game. honestly her early game strength is just crazy, her passive is basically another conq so it just overpowers any other champion
[2:52:46] <snowboltt> It's a little hard to deal damage when you're dead.
[2:52:49] <SVN19> It’s like not building a zeal item on a Crit adc

[3:04:06] <somekindofgoth> @DodgeballGaming yea, riot did this intentionally. they said they wanted to change their philosophy of making weird convoluted champions because they're really hard to balance. instead they gave them simple abilities which are easier to tune
[3:04:09] <INTHELAVA> This botlane
[3:04:20] <MidEastBeast9> You actually cant Tumble out of it
[3:04:38] <firefighterclaimedbyflame> @voyboy would a statik shiv proc kill all the small minions of yorick?
[3:04:43] <MNAZerk> @DodgeballGaming sylas seems pretty strong right now but that's only cause of the tourney. he's not as useful if he cant steal an AOE ult
[3:04:46] <DodgeballGaming> @somekindofgoth but it’s kind of boring... like it’s fun to get a more crazy champ...
[3:04:49] <SmoothOctopus> What Keystone he using?
[3:05:02] <DeadSmooch> @dodgeballgaming sylas is decent but neeko and yuumi feel way too simple. Yuumi had so much potential but I feel like they didn’t actually get much out of her concept.

[3:05:50] <squidlymom> its 2

[3:07:00] <xskarr> Stoooopid
[3:07:04] <MNAZerk> sylas overall winrate however shows he is balanced if not slightly weak. he's definitely someone that u need to consider the enemy picks and ur own comp before selecting
[3:07:05] <Ekkologix> @Voyboy voy ur the reason why i get these vayne tops that int my games can u plox stop doing that D:
[3:07:06] <hotdogss> 7-1 BlessRNG
[3:07:13] <DodgeballGaming> @somekindofgoth I guess... Zoe hasn’t bothered me personally though... maybe because I’m a low rank and people suck booty...
[3:07:24] <Jakerbean> that tower gettin in the mix lol
[3:07:31] <DeadSmooch> Zoe is actually fun tho
[3:07:35] <Whips_Back> @mnazerk depends on their ults tbh too lol
[3:07:41] <mood_rings> Can I get an F in chat for Edmure “Shooters Shoot” Tully
[3:07:44] <MNAZerk> @Whips_Back exactly
[3:07:46] <DodgeballGaming> Agreed
[3:07:47] <its_ya_boy_noah> get him
[3:07:54] <yn8346> LUL
[3:07:54] <FeeshyGaming> your trolling
[3:08:00] <knacktoknack> too HYPHY xd
[3:08:03] <its_ya_boy_noah> it was a bait
[3:08:07] <MNAZerk> @Whips_Back sylas for example would be fairly useless vs. a team who had ults like vayne
[3:08:08] <somekindofgoth> @DodgeballGaming zoe's really annoying to balance because she's designed to one shot you, and getting one shot never feels good. but take away her ability to one shot and she's useless, so it's like, there's no solution
[3:08:16] <DeadSmooch> Feels more satisfying to do damage as her whereas neeko is just like, “oh look I hit my E and get a free Q”
[3:08:18] <DodgeballGaming> @deadsmooch Zoe is super fun
[3:08:18] <blueisagreatcolor> but he pinged back
[3:08:22] <blueisagreatcolor> so he wasnt gonna go
[3:08:25] <SmoothOctopus> Sylas was the one pinning the fall back lol
[3:08:27] <joweni38> ye zoe sylas slightly weak :)
[3:08:28] <pain423> NOCT ULT
[3:08:30] <nutelIIa> dont rely on teamates to look at map
[3:08:40] <Jobbieh> you dont ping voy, voy pings you !
[3:08:41] <rare213> Sneak dissin
[3:08:49] <tazzerer> @MNAZerk when sylas steals vayne's ult he becomes invis after using q, it's far from useless I'd say
[3:09:00] <H2oceans> VOOBY
[3:09:00] <WhatUpTho20> lol
[3:09:02] <chouse12> @deadsmooch You just described Zoe’s play pattern
[3:09:03] <its_ya_boy_noah> it doesnt
[3:09:04] <iTonyxo> lmao i thought it would work to
[3:09:05] <ShadowJet0> can't stun yorick on his own wall boxNOTLIKETHIS

[3:09:16] <nagisacried> lol u almost trolled
[3:09:21] <its_ya_boy_noah> PixelBob
[3:09:22] <lordtiton> !opgg
[3:09:23] <knacktoknack> he can walk through it lol ofc it doesnt
[3:09:24] <DodgeballGaming> @somekindofgoth yeah, that makes sense. But I still feel like the elements in the new champs kits could be a bit more interesting, Sylas aside
[3:09:29] <SmoothOctopus> Cause yorick wall team mates can walk through
[3:09:30] <dixonks> it's not a wall for the enemy
[3:09:33] <nihilisticcoffeedrinker> he can move through his own wall
[3:09:37] <toocool4youdude> poor yorick
[3:09:39] <MNAZerk> @tazzerer ah i see. but that is more for an ap assasin than it is for a mid-line like sylas. definitely gives it utility, but i say he is best picked vs. an ap heavy comp with aoe ultimates
[3:09:41] <ElStaffo> It works if he is on yor team :p
[3:09:46] <prime66> arctic monkeys <3
[3:09:52] <Og12310> @Voyboy yorick wall is only for his enemies
[3:09:59] <DeadSmooch> @chouse12 I realize that now, but still look at the difference between Zoe’s E-Q and neeko’s.
[3:10:07] <host_chan> fun MU ResidentSleeper
[3:10:16] <somekindofgoth> @DodgeballGaming yeah maybe the next ones will be. neeko was especially ResidentSleeper so hopefully they don't do anything like that again for a while
[3:10:25] <SmoothOctopus> Does anyone ever play Neeko?
[3:10:28] <Dezorey> I love Neeko tbh
[3:10:38] <nutelIIa> gotta side roll those es
[3:10:39] <SmoothOctopus> I can't remember the last time I saw her outside ARAM

[3:10:43] <DodgeballGaming> @somekindofgoth the AD assassin seems like he will be pretty sick

[3:11:00] <umop_aplsdn> u tried to e into yorick wall level 5 when u tried to all in but u didn't get the xp and survived with 5 hp

[3:11:08] <SmoothOctopus> Neat
[3:11:10] <chouse12> Glacial neeko is a lot of fun and pretty good in 3 roles too

[3:11:12] <Dezorey> Neeko is the only mid I play, love neekster
[3:11:31] <DodgeballGaming> @smoothoctopus I actually really like playing neeko. I enjoy the new champs because they are simple to play. But I like the crazy stuff too

[3:23:59] <DodgeballGaming> @mainaim29 seven nation army by the white stripes I believe
[3:24:08] <MNAZerk> @DodgeballGaming not sure how riot would incorporate that but im sure theyd be all for it due to publicity.
[3:24:09] <SmoothOctopus> Yes that is the song
[3:24:11] <deadpool4969> I stopped watching after game 2. They weren’t thinking and just seeing how much vision control g2 had told me TL wasn’t ready
[3:24:14] <chouse12> @bughole Double and xmithie are American though
[3:24:15] <Deadmanengin> EU>NA easy win

[3:24:18] <Bughole> @Whips_Back TL had 4 asians, 3 of which were imported I think
[3:24:20] <rawrerling> I cant go to yemen, Im a analyst!
[3:24:20] <nutelIIa> @Bughole so you think white people should represent na
[3:24:40] <DodgeballGaming> @mnazerk @trickydickey I feel like it should have its own separate type of olympics though. I don’t think it fits into the summit or Winter Olympics

[4:01:53] <sanderbroek> 2 zonhjas?
[4:01:55] <Laranthir> @agentwent trolls wouldnt enjoy it if they didnt get so much reaction back from the others.
[4:01:56] <sirawesomepossum> im so happy to see voy is streaming

[4:02:23] <iambaerserker> FLAGVANUS11 thanks for the spoiler
[4:02:25] <TheNoviceMoe> Hey guys how do I show the range/direction my ability will be going?
[4:02:29] <lexanbel> who is jon snow
[4:02:36] <Kermitigated> @misskirigoe no spoilers!
[4:02:37] <TheNoviceMoe> I tried to do it in-game but only the circle(range) keep sshowing
[4:02:43] <FLAGVANUS11> @GuaCaMuLLy 2nd season is a tiny bit worse, but it was nice. the 3rd it gonna be online 2020 and they gonna show us the real world.
[4:02:44] <Wasabi__Knight> Why is jon snow distThink
[4:02:47] <Laranthir> @FLAGVANUS11 yeah drama lasted longer than whitewalkers. Ended in a heartbeat like an anime battle
[4:02:49] <agentwent> @Laranthir yea but u cant blame'em, they just want to have that experience, some extra information is just frustrating
[4:02:52] <tilt_chase> @TheNoviceMoe Turn quick cast off
[4:02:58] <Twotched5201> HYPERS Channel the PowerUpR of United, boys, for voy! HYPERS
[4:03:00] <GuaCaMuLLy> @FLAGVANUS11 honestly they shoulda introduced some white walker that was invulnerable WAYY back and then have us forget about him. and then when kings landing gets destroyed, all the dead get blue eyes and come back to life, and he shows up POG
[4:03:08] <Perceftionist> honestly the worst thing in GOT is the fast that Sonic doesnt make his appearance until the last episode
[4:03:10] <Sgt_Quacky> What happens when you steal ori ult? do you get the ball as well or?
[4:03:16] <vitusalinas> Wait, did Jon Snow know that Bran was Superman?
