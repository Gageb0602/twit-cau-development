[2:01:10] <StreamElements> I sense that you chose to be a professional priest hearthstone player because in real life you are a rebellious young man who hates that his parents made him go to church and so you act out by listening to this rock music, wear black clothing and speak in a low monotone voice. but deep down in your soul you want your your parents to love you so you manifest this desire by playing priest in game. it is a manifestation of your subconscious mind.

[2:33:57] <splendid_RNGesus> @Zetalot just play another class 4Head
[2:34:01] <teamantaylor> Hagatha is a good example for a hero card
[2:34:14] <gulldune> @violeteden not comported to Priest Hero Card Kapp
[2:34:20] <gulldune> Compared*
[2:34:23] <Jayjajy> Zul'jin isnt that broken either when you consider how RNG can screw you over
[2:34:45] <jeblucas> I think Boom would be fine if they didn’t make every decent Warrior card a Mech.
[2:34:49] <VioletEden> Zuljin is only OP because of the 5/5 rush
[2:34:59] <thegunnerth14> hagatha is op
[2:35:16] <thegunnerth14> if shaman was more popular people will complain 100%
[2:35:25] <gulldune> Well the 5/5 rush exists lmao
[2:35:29] <teamantaylor> If it's an auto-include in every class deck it's busted. Dr Boom is in every warrior deck. Hagatha isn't seen in multiple shaman archetypes, just control/big shaman
[2:35:33] <VioletEden> Hagatha effect: for every minion you play add a totemic might to your hand
[2:35:57] <alexander_of_greece> i think i saw one whacky mechathun warrior list that didnt run boom Kappa
[2:36:00] <eleafl> only reason Hagatha isn't completely OP is because Shaman has so many shitty spells

[3:33:49] <Gl33cerine> @c85hernandez but then you need 2 more seasons
[3:33:54] <OPisland> Can chat explain wtf the point was of the golden company? They did literally nothing
[3:33:54] <Gl33cerine> at the very least
[3:34:12] <c85hernandez> @gl33cerine the show NEEDED two more seasons
[3:34:20] <crvyxn> signed it LULW
[3:34:27] <Zeroww> @Zetalot Keep going, I love your stream, thanks for all these hours of entertainment !
[3:34:29] <Morvalus> That petition is so childish. Like yeah the writing was bad but what the fuck is the point lmao
[3:34:29] <Gl33cerine> @c85hernandez obviously, but they didn't do it
[3:35:21] <thedrow_hs> Tool <3
[3:35:23] <c85hernandez> We did get almost 30 seconds of edmure Tully cringe tho
[3:35:28] <c85hernandez> That was worth the wait
[3:35:33] <Zenomalous> @OPisland the point is that they were supposed to be impressive but got annihilated anyway. I think the main problem is in the way the writers write the show compared to the books. They are going for the emotions and stringing people along
[3:35:40] <Zenomalous> It became predictable
[3:35:40] <Gl33cerine> edmure zetaFeels
[3:36:05] <zEeoNHS> I feel like I'd be that guy if I were a character from GoT
[3:36:07] <c85hernandez> During that scene I was like, really, they’re wasting time on this joke?
[3:36:15] <ravenonthechest> any sane person understands that HBO wouldn't actually remake this season. It was fot showing how outraged fans was
[3:36:47] <ChickenPawks> @ravenonthechest it worked for Sonic Kappa
[3:36:52] <c85hernandez> @zetalot this is now GOT stream. Please livestream starting from season one.
[3:36:57] <DrBalanced_> this whole season Pepega
[3:37:00] <zEeoNHS> I honestly don't get HBO's logic though. Are they aware that now there is no reason to basically keep a subscription to their channel going?
[3:37:10] <swickles> @c85hernandez pls do not
[3:37:11] <zEeoNHS> What do they actually gain from speeding things up
[3:37:13] <Gl33cerine> guy did an amazing military feat in the books, then married a frey girl for robb, then got imprisonned for years and sansa diss him even though he's the lord of riverrun and a major politic figure in westeros landscape BrokeBack
[3:37:21] <OPisland> @Zenomalous Right, and what about Jon's hertiage? Turns out it had zero relevance. Or the Night King, he just died?!, or Arya's face swapping, had zero impact on the story as well, or that Warhorn they found that was supposed to be important, or the sand snakes in the dungeon, etc etc
[3:37:29] <c85hernandez> @zeeonhs freedom to pursue other things
[3:37:38] <swickles> @zEeoNHS they don't have to pay as much to the actors and they can crack on with star wars
[3:37:52] <Gl33cerine> @zEeoNHS not really their fault they offered money for more seasons
[3:38:00] <zEeoNHS> I see
[3:38:02] <Gl33cerine> besides they got some good other series and will have got spinoff
[3:38:02] <Zeroww> @Zetalot is your computer too weak for 1080p streaming ?
[3:38:12] <Zenomalous> @OPisland yeah it all went in the way that gets the most feels in the moment. They just went for cool moments
[3:38:16] <DrBalanced_> the writers wanted to move on to star wars 4Head
[3:38:26] <Zenomalous> Have you seen the writers talk about the show after the episode?
[3:38:45] <Gl33cerine> I kind of forgot about it @Zenomalous
[3:38:46] <Zenomalous> The way they explain how they made decisions is not how the books were written
[3:39:09] <DrBalanced_> writers about episeode 3: "here we see the end of the dothraki" OMEGALUL

[3:39:29] <ravenonthechest> kit harrington(jon snow) reaction to all of this was fantastic. "if you feel let down by the season then go fuck yourself"
[3:39:53] <Zenomalous> Really? Wow
[3:39:53] <degenerate_afro> Zul'jin
[3:40:08] <Zenomalous> I didn't see that, so the actors were all cool with the writing?
[3:40:08] <zEeoNHS> I like how she attacked the ships with two dragons, then freaked out. Then she came back with literally the same plan but 1 less dragons and somehow manages to just kill every turret in 5 minutes
