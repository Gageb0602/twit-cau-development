[0:30:45] <yaboigingerninja> 1v1 faze jarvis
[0:30:45] <hugetinyrb> I read through tfue's claim a bit, it is more about the revenue from sponsors then faze not taking money. Faze may not take 80% of tfues money from when they make a deal with sponsors, but they are allowed to take up to 80% and tfue isn't allowed to seek sponsors without Faze's permission
[0:30:46] <tbnrquickattack> so are u allowed to talk about how long the contract is

[1:05:40] <dawnspiite> So you're going by "mrfreshasian" now plebian? Haha what's up spurcifer, it's Tannerius from Rome. Remember me? Me and the other legionaries used to give a hard time. Sorry you were just an easy target. I can see not much has changed. Remember Seira, the girl you had a crush on? Yeah, she's my concubine now. I make over 200 sesterces a year and drive a quadriga chariot. I guess some things never change huh? Nice catching up. Patheticus.
