[6:12:56] <kkamdungisaranghaeyeo> Hey mrfreshasian, I've noticed most of the professional and more skilled players general play on lower sensitivity. I wanted to be able to try and attempt at making the conversion since I'm not seeing results playing on this higher sensitivity. I currently use 0.160 in game and 1800 DPI. Is there a way to train other than creative, since everyone's so much better now in BR.

[8:55:13] <Ehryen> @mrfreshasian it's not that checkpoints dont work, they're bugged, if muselk and u die at the same time on the same level one will get set back, it's not the map it's creative
