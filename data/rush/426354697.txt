[2:18:37] <xGrompTV> MAP AWARENESS Pog
[2:18:43] <lesurouss> @Rush Just black cleaver HP.
[2:18:45] <xAikado> @Rush Apparently Aatrox has like 7% advantage in matchup against Irelia
[2:18:47] <Falconhami> I think you are ment to stay away from here while she pushes
[2:18:48] <InferiorBetaMan> Deaths Dance 😡
[2:18:48] <dreads> is rush growing a goatee? Pog
[2:18:56] <reploid34> weSmart
[2:19:01] <jdNx> no, a fumanchu
[2:19:04] <lesurouss> Full item Deaths Dance would also be a lot of damage mitigation and would off set her grievous wounds.
[2:19:13] <InferiorBetaMan> Deaths Dance calebS Deaths Dance calebS
[2:19:13] <Oneeyedpete6> @Rush black cleaver has hp, ad AND cdr PogU
[2:19:21] <sunnify> i like how he's constantly thinking and asking questions to himself and doesnt tilt
[2:19:25] <nealOG> tfueHIGH
[2:19:28] <dKs89> it wasn't happening when you know, you were even in lane, but once she killed you and got ahead
