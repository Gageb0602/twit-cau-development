They have Zven, professional choker and MVP of the series for Team Liquid. You have Impact, former world champion and the tank god ready to reclaim his title, and there is nothing that will stand in his way.

[3:45:55] <Cassian12> bot
[3:45:57] <BRONZE4_SMURF> league is also a lot slower paced and you have the time to type
[3:46:01] <murkJose> @eC_Haze It can still be done in chat or add a mute button to voice comms
[3:46:23] <AndAGramOfGinger> gachiBASS
[3:46:36] <sloppy_topper> PogChamp
[3:46:40] <AndAGramOfGinger> you should just stop playing league
[3:46:41] <murkJose> It's the internet
[3:46:44] <FyreViper> why shouldn't you not have to mute people

[3:46:51] <Oliver_Atton_2> why you inting rush
[3:46:52] <leafretv> ?????
[3:46:53] <FyreViper> they are all gonna suck atleast give us the option
[3:46:54] <deathman105> top xd
[3:46:56] <0zeyn0> why not just ult the karth? he has red
[3:46:56] <Oliver_Atton_2> just go for khartus
[3:47:00] <AmroHani> kill karthus lol
[3:47:06] <murkJose> 2 or 3 people having comms is better than 0. There's a reason why these guys duo to climb ladder at the beginning of seasons
[3:47:09] <fatpep> yes :)
[3:47:18] <AltoKnight> @mageofrevenge ur my favorite
[3:47:18] <hacha0313> because karthus will still do dmg while dead, akali wont
[3:47:19] <xKing_Shaman> @Rush i like ur moustache :)
[3:47:26] <AndAGramOfGinger> because they actually can and its boring as fuck?
[3:47:36] <mageofrevenge> @AltoKnight no ur my favorite
[3:47:38] <VandesGrants> yet the best solo queue players still manage to climb to the top, without comms
[3:47:51] <eiratxk> comms will make the game worse, everyone too toxic anyways
[3:47:52] <murkJose> Hell even when I duo with my bro I win more games than when I have 0 comms with the rest of my team in solos
[3:47:55] <TitanDestruction> so mute them
[3:47:56] <deathman105> rush how does it feel to talk to nothing
[3:48:01] <TitanDestruction> no different than chat
[3:48:03] <leafretv> most people won't even actually use voice coms like you guys want
[3:48:04] <bazeko> do most people troll in other games with comms? no
[3:48:07] <VandesGrants> "me want comms" is just another argument from low elo players who think not having it is why they cant climb
[3:48:10] <AndAGramOfGinger> ???
[3:48:10] <murkJose> @TitanDestruction Exactly
[3:48:12] <Delectable> @gen1 rooHi
