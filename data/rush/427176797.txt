[2:11:45] <Pogram> what rush just said is monkey talk for "better jungler wins"
[2:11:46] <diablokillo> ejfsidflsd;hglas;gsdfh;alsdhgasldhgasf
[2:11:47] <ibesupreme> NEED FUNNY GUY
[2:11:48] <Demon_Dancer> I think the only reason that servers arent smack dab in middle is bc there are no large enough server centers in midwest
[2:12:00] <soouzza> @thisisdedication because eu has 2x and china has 50x the server population of NA
[2:12:02] <goodbunny> pvmanHYPERS
[2:12:10] <TheVillagerKR> thisisdedication Two distincts servers if that's what you mean yes, each respective servers use one server
[2:12:13] <alex23sv> @thisisdedication Becasue not only would queue times be much higher, but competition would be much lower. Serers with more people tend to do better internationally too, China, Korea and EU are the regions with more players and they are clearly top 3.
[2:12:15] <jetmcquack89> @rush strong mental...un got this Kappa
[2:12:19] <diablokillo> @Demon_Dancer thats right
[2:12:24] <Hossamov> Rush is slowly turning into a true NA player
[2:12:35] <NaturalLemon> rush if u joined LCS again u would of been champion jungler in MSI
[2:12:37] <NaturalLemon> Kappa
[2:12:38] <thisisdedication> Why are people so inclined to defending status quo bad ping servers
[2:12:40] <sanchcakes> no cam = rush sad boy?
[2:12:48] <cinegoleg> That Vel'koz save
[2:12:49] <diablokillo> @Hossamov he is there alrady
[2:12:51] <goodbunny> if u joined LCS again LULW
[2:12:51] <Dorkspork> na doesnt have enough players for two competitive masters plus divisions
[2:12:54] <CuteSpacesuit> no cam=try hard
[2:12:56] <Nolja_> Korea got smashed lmao
[2:13:08] <perkalerk> all that ward xp Pog
[2:13:08] <sujen> LULW
[2:13:11] <soouzza> @thisisdedication i dont defend bad ping servers lol, just the 2 server solution is awful. imo lcs should move to server location
[2:13:12] <thisisdedication> I'd 1000% rather have what classic blizz games did with east west servers
[2:13:13] <NaturalLemon> Rush doesnt need a team. he is korean. so he is number 1
[2:13:14] <rudi91> kha Pepega
[2:13:19] <Hussao> @Demon_Dancer it's really not just the server distance, there's more to it, people that live in the other end of brazil don't get such a high ping on br servers
[2:13:20] <pikachuloveoppai> a

[2:13:51] <CuteSpacesuit> NA why so quiet kappa
[2:14:01] <Mordailus> TL OMEGALUL
[2:14:03] <alex23sv> @thisisdedication Becuase that ping is not that bad. Anyone that plays seriously in Europe plays in EUW, even if they are from countries that should play in EUNE. And 60 + ping is common for a lot of those countries.
[2:14:03] <bourgeo1s> TL is hot trash LUL
[2:14:12] <s0muh> thinking chicago is trash shipWEIRD
[2:14:14] <Fmarst> only southside chicago is trash, lakeside is really nice
[2:14:19] <NaturalLemon> IG THREW MSI. they only care for worlds right now
[2:14:21] <Pogram> hot trash that beat the defending world champs
[2:14:21] <bourgeo1s> IG made TL win so that they'd look like a joke in the Finals LUL
[2:14:24] <lak_has_luck> @Dorkspork why would LCS move to chicago? LUL

[2:14:45] <zZexal> what is tier one tournament?
[2:14:45] <gamerrakzo> clintAY
[2:14:47] <zZexal> tcs?
[2:14:48] <thisisdedication> The middle of the country should have 60 ping on both servers and the highly dense populated coasts should have 10-20 ping.
[2:14:49] <NaturalLemon> WORLDS
[2:14:58] <zZexal> tcs is tier one
