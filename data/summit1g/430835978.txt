[1:28:51] <clayton_bigsb> @TheMomentium right. and im talking about this bugged ass rain noise lol
[1:28:53] <wassup3337> @Lsrv really depends on what you wanna spend aswell Intel usually for gaming but you can get AMd for cheaper
[1:28:56] <ImaybeStoned> Backstory is AI is in charge now The singularity has passed SurVive
[1:28:58] <magman4> what is intel
[1:28:59] <CommenceDaRagin> toers with the domes have better loot than the atc towers @summit1g
[1:28:59] <cscruggs24> Hes grabbing the pistols to get aim
[1:29:02] <Snorkelen013> @Lsrv AMD is coming out with new CPUs very very soon. I got a 9700k right now but AMDs new line might compete very very well with 9700k and 9900k
[1:29:02] <magman4> in the game
[1:29:03] <BastionBlast> Is this game any good?
[1:29:04] <stevethetank> @Lsrv Everyone will say Intel but AMD is right there with them and they are much cheaper without a huge performance gap.
[1:29:04] <Iessthenthree> Objective: Dont Die 4Head

[1:29:15] <JesseLee> @igoatyouu Good question
[1:29:16] <magman4> what does intel do
[1:29:16] <lonewi> @DividedSinger90 more crafting, and stash size increase
[1:29:18] <TheStevieJ> @summit1g them towers with crystals on give good loot
[1:29:19] <ripersnifle> This game bares no resemblance to tarkov whatsoever
[1:29:20] <starry26> monkaS
[1:29:24] <dane3206> do these robots just keep on spawning in?
[1:29:25] <SLHHunter> whats the point of the levels?

[1:29:45] <Armageddon2517> or kill trade
[1:29:45] <rolloff0017> @summit1g the towers with the globe on top are really good for loot
[1:29:45] <clayton_bigsb> @TheMomentium big true
[1:29:46] <Karnage_105> people would probably farm their buddies
[1:29:47] <8gates> what do you get for gaining levels?
[1:29:47] <spacedpillow893> is there much of ammo issues in this game?
[1:29:50] <cscruggs24> thats plus 2 skill rating tho right
[1:29:51] <Azathul> sounds like greek in steel flip flops
[1:29:52] <RoadMan1994> +10 it should be for players tbh, when rep comes out change it
[1:29:53] <30odd06> the point of the levels are more global inventory space
[1:29:54] <slickyism> @summit1g well I mean you could farm
[1:29:55] <sTEWIE_5> its kill rating that increases when killing people I think, not XP @summit1g

[2:56:47] <RahhhSir> Key Takeaways: Can You Drink Rain? Most rain is perfectly safe to drink and may be even cleaner than the public water supply. Rain water is only as clean as its container. Only rain that has fallen directly from the sky should be collected for drinking. It should not have touched plants or buildings. Boiling and filtering rainwater will make it even safer to drink. When You Shouldn't Drink Rain Water Rain passes through the atmosphere before falling to the ground, so it can pick up any contamina

[3:01:30] <twisteddarkness> Levelling up unlocks enhanced skills, for example inflicting more PvE damage or being harder to spot by robots. You can gain improved medical treatment abilities or even drone buffs, besides opening up new recipes for crafting and an increased stash size.

[5:11:03] <MegaMunchy> optichero no way your actively updating a live tornado. I don't believe it.
[5:11:04] <DrizzeyDrazz> i tbh never did that once
[5:11:07] <HazyRan9er> So aaaaaaa 20subs for the sniper??
[5:11:08] <Dat863boi> i would just move servers, that dropzone is going to be insane with spawns for the next 30 mins
[5:11:09] <fetalgiraffe> for real @optichero123
[5:11:12] <Reconyx> was epic watching him explode into a pile of loot after getting one shot by the sniper
[5:11:17] <lmao__21> I love sinep
[5:11:18] <cscruggs24> who got the sniper just got back
[5:11:18] <theonlytoeknee> what do you think of the game so far sum?

[5:11:20] <DrizzeyDrazz> never played war z
[5:11:20] <SoDaHammer> this game seems much smoother than miscreated
[5:11:21] <R3WINDZ12_> i cant wait for solo servers
[5:11:30] <ysondoa> @GamesheepGames my problem is thats its unnecessary so write something like that in chat. Because the streamer is gonna play what he wants not what some viewer wants. Its just unnecessary
[5:11:31] <Mumit27> @optichero123 monkaEyes and your still on your PC?!? the balls on you must be amazing
[5:11:34] <RJRinfamous> @summit1g Do you ever miss the old H1Z1 days?

[6:08:49] <twisteddarkness> @derschmor, Levelling up unlocks enhanced skills, for example inflicting more PvE damage or being harder to spot by robots. You can gain improved medical treatment abilities or even drone buffs, besides opening up new recipes for crafting and an increased stash size.

[7:19:45] <IcedYoshi> @Ausden I am one of the staff members
[7:19:47] <macncheeze> stop being too agressive summit, this isnt CSGO LUL
[7:19:51] <Kak_1> And I say that as someone who never played WarZ and loved DayZ
[7:19:51] <goodkidmaadcity> aggression is not the meta
[7:19:52] <cptsunnyday> @ozilago Warz
[7:19:52] <931MONSTER> He healed he was at 44 after the heal. so he was either 24% or 4%
[7:19:53] <zRazii> Interesting
[7:19:53] <nuns0nnarcotics> try to hard to be like shroud
[7:19:54] <Ishney94> shiii

[7:20:03] <geiseric442> melee
[7:20:04] <ThundarUp> I think introducing new weapons and offering a couple different maps, as well as customization of weapon and soldier skins will help attract players
[7:20:04] <stopitdan> summit dont give a fuck
[7:20:04] <truetruer> shhh @beautifulgorgeous
[7:20:05] <Strawberry__> 931MONSTER , i enjoy watching Summit playing warz & now i enjoy him playing XERA
[7:20:10] <geiseric442> bring an axe @summit1g
[7:20:11] <i_am_stin> @vonhelms u smell PepeLaugh
[7:20:11] <rqneverlucky> @IcedYoshi to bad you guys banned one of my friends falsely because the guy next to him was yelling the N on dk's streams.
[7:20:12] <chunkxilla> gotta go nuts bro
[7:20:17] <BeautifulGorgeous> @truetruer LUL
[7:20:17] <Ishney94> this game needs base building BibleThump BibleThump
[7:20:28] <DecoyAkiba> @icedyoshi possible console release in the future?
[7:20:29] <Hadez> does sum know about skin changing?
[7:20:32] <gwooley> Baked beans PogChamp
[7:20:33] <Moses_06> I'd rather they just expand on this map than create new ones and split the player base
[7:20:35] <931MONSTER> @Strawberry__ Same here
[7:20:39] <macncheeze> @Ishney94 no fuck that
[7:20:40] <NiteshadezTV> @hadez yes
[7:20:40] <moinoXtheboss> @summit1g someone farm for it ?
[7:20:40] <BrotherHank> throwe2Tia throwe2Tia throwe2Tia warZ is BACK!!
[7:20:44] <IcedYoshi> @DecoyAkiba It's not planned as of now
[7:20:45] <Proj3cta> @rqneverlucky Thats why I'm gonna try to never be in a server with a stramer
[7:20:46] <gdkoopa> @Hadez yea
[7:20:46] <Nick__Knack> @rqneverlucky How many times you gonna say it before you realize he don't care
[7:20:48] <CantEvenSin> Isn't this just the same war z game reskinned and sold to people agin..?
[7:20:51] <Leetmcfeet> rqn, try not to be a nobody like your friends mate, roflmao
[7:20:52] <Hadez> kk
[7:20:57] <Vega_Eidolon> why do they always do cool shit on NoPixel after Charles leaves? LUL
[7:20:59] <awpulent> @Ishney94 I disagree. I really dont like base building in these games because then you just get locked out of parts of the maps and offline raiding happens
[7:21:10] <StankyStu> yes sin
[7:21:13] <Pedrosasus> i miss so much warz man @summit1g
[7:21:13] <BrotherHank> @summit1g started on warz, now you end on warz throwe2Tia throwe2Tia
[7:21:14] <schuster_> What does scopes do? Since his not ADSing?
[7:21:15] <crazii4lyfe> @summit1g is this game worth getting?
[7:21:15] <StankyStu> they all have been
[7:21:18] <rqneverlucky> @Nick__Knack Well you seem to care LUL
[7:21:19] <chunkxilla> @Vega_Eidolon what you mean brotherrrrr?
[7:21:26] <skylarrichardson> Don’t forget to attach your attachments
[7:21:27] <gdkoopa> ADS
[7:21:28] <CantEvenSin> RIP people keep buying them.
[7:21:30] <awpulent> @IcedYoshi Please do not put in base building. It'll kill the 'feeling' of the game, imo
[7:21:30] <gdkoopa> 1st person?
[7:21:32] <JohntheOGDon710> @IcedYoshi does the suppressor or red dot have any effect
[7:21:35] <TFR2313> couldnt people just sit outside of camp and pick you off?
[7:21:36] <Vega_Eidolon> @chunkxilla they are doing paintball atm
[7:21:37] <CantEvenSin> They're all the same lol this should be illegal.
[7:21:40] <Nick__Knack> @rqneverlucky Yeah I really do actually, let me fix it right up for you
[7:21:44] <Ryem> i get it, miscreated 4k resolution ?
[7:21:44] <Symbiote_Riot> I think its just for first person
[7:21:45] <Expogy> @summit1g thats a negative on the scopes
[7:21:46] <gwooley> awpulent agreed, the stash system is enough
[7:21:48] <931MONSTER> I don't think they do. They're just used for 1st person
[7:21:48] <DrizzeyDrazz> no first person sum?
[7:21:50] <NiteshadezTV> @TFR2313 Yes, people do that
[7:21:52] <whyt3ninja> @summit1g collision might be off right now
[7:21:52] <i_am_stin> Base building would ruin this game
[7:21:54] <MyCondolences228> @summit1g if u get back to tarkov u gonna love labs its intense pve pvp
[7:21:58] <bumbumkerem2> @TFR2313 they do actually :D
[7:21:59] <StankyStu> that is why they keep distancing themselves from the previous version
[7:21:59] <awpulent> Correct @summit1g
[7:21:59] <S1L3NT_0001> High @summit1g
[7:22:01] <cookiesamilk> This game out yet ? Price ?
[7:22:02] <voops> @Vega_Eidolon They did that while summit played too, he just never cared.
[7:22:02] <Funkimaniac> Go first person @summit1g
[7:22:05] <IcedYoshi> @john suppressor silences weapons to a degree. Red dot works in first person
[7:22:07] <macncheeze> yes, please no base building
[7:22:07] <gdkoopa> @CantEvenSin then dont buy it why do you give a shit
[7:22:08] <v_i_i_c_i_o_u_Z> FOR RAIDS
[7:22:11] <Hadez> They need a name above head toggle like ISS had
[7:22:13] <awpulent> Do not put in base building. I'm not trying to offline raided
[7:22:14] <rqneverlucky> @Nick__Knack stop talking to me will ya?
[7:22:14] <StankyStu> one dev is all it took to reskin warz
[7:22:15] <cykomane> outpost
[7:22:17] <eddiejc44> a base just gives something for people to take all your shit while you log off. @summit1g
[7:22:19] <crabman899> Is there first person only servers ? @summit1g
[7:22:21] <lizzykoopa> go play rust then Kappa
[7:22:22] <NguyenAdam> New game?
[7:22:22] <awpulent> raids are dumb
[7:22:23] <Vega_Eidolon> @voops Didn't know
[7:22:24] <TFR2313> @niteshadeztv fuckers lol
[7:22:26] <crixisgaming> so you spawned in the same instance or a new one??
[7:22:26] <Eldari1369> @PlayXERA Any super rare weapons or armor? stuff that you would immediately want to go bank? Or is everything fairly common?
[7:22:27] <Kak_1> This is currently a third person game, him going first person just puts him at a disadvantage until they have first person servers
[7:22:27] <vonHelms> @i_am_stin sumSuh
[7:22:29] <MrNoCentz> wait this isnt tarkov
[7:22:30] <v_i_i_c_i_o_u_Z> BASE BUILDING FOR RAIDS
[7:22:30] <macncheeze> Does this game allow you to switch to First Person?
[7:22:34] <IcedYoshi> @crabman899 They will be coming in the future
[7:22:34] <greymoonmusic> maybe the ability to build walls, ramps pyramids and floors?
[7:22:34] <voops> @Vega_Eidolon no worries :)
[7:22:39] <Smackiing> yo is this made by the war Z / New Z people? looks so much the same lol
[7:22:41] <Nick__Knack> @rqneverlucky You got it

[7:22:48] <JohntheOGDon710> mine doesn't work either
[7:22:49] <BakedAmerican> bases are for raiding and more pvp that shit fun @summit1g
[7:22:49] <IcedYoshi> @Eldari1369 Snipers I would bank right away
[7:22:49] <i_am_stin> @vonHelms OMEGALUL
[7:22:56] <awpulent> @Smackiing no , simple googling is your friend
[7:22:56] <Funkimaniac> I'm just saying if you go in first person you ca use the red dot
[7:23:01] <gwooley> IcedYoshi So when are you guys adding jets Kappa
[7:23:02] <BeautifulGorgeous> Oh shit What time does it Start? @summit1g
[7:23:05] <Joshua_NZ> @Smackiing no

[7:23:10] <goldenvulden> @summit1g Is split gate even a good game?
[7:23:12] <en0rm0usta1nt> yo @summit1g say a little prayer for Ohio and my sister and nieces, we just had a massive tornado outbreak and she lost the roof to her house. #feelsbadman
[7:23:12] <Leetmcfeet> smacking is dumb lol

[7:23:17] <sonicbagel> Is the pvp even fun though? What’s the point of gathering all this loot?
[7:23:19] <GoofyHand> have you played splitgate in a while?
[7:23:20] <IcedYoshi> @gwooley When we soar to the moon Kappa
[7:23:23] <youbetcha825> @summit1g do airdrops land in random locations or are they set in several specific points?
[7:23:24] <l4yl0w_> @IcedYoshi is there vaulting in this game?
[7:23:25] <Smackiing> @awpulent why would i google you just answered
[7:23:26] <simao99l> Yo summit have u tried mordhau
[7:23:27] <jamesach> what
[7:23:28] <truetruer> @macncheeze yes
[7:23:30] <Sclawss> I'd love to play this game, but sadly I feel like it's one of those games that die when summit stops playing it :(

[7:23:45] <IcedYoshi> @l4yl0w_ Not as of now (if you mean vaulting over walls)
[7:23:48] <skylarrichardson> Can you try to first person someone in a gunfight
[7:23:50] <Pedrosasus> @summit1g how is the first person?
[7:23:55] <I_Am_Vital> is this early access purchase or a beta that requires invite?
[7:23:55] <CrowdControlRMRS> Red patches of flowers got to go, forest looks ok otherwise, bit more detail
[7:23:59] <awpulent> @Smackiing You would google instead of asking simple questions because you want to be a better person and believing people in twitch chat is fucking stupid
[7:24:00] <l4yl0w_> @IcedYoshi thanks
[7:24:02] <hijikatagintoki312> this guy really likes playing weird games
[7:24:05] <youbetcha825> cool thanks bud
[7:24:09] <Bobbuslee> are they planning on having private servers?
[7:24:10] <NiteshadezTV> @I_Am_Vital on Steaam
[7:24:12] <roms1422> how many players per server?
[7:24:19] <Ishney94> if this game gets base buildung, then put it on a different type of server
[7:24:19] <IcedYoshi> @Bobbuslee yes
[7:24:20] <tythemoose> is this BR
[7:24:21] <Proj3cta> @rqneverlucky Yup, killing a streamer is too risky for me to wanna play against em

[7:24:59] <Dolphinxv> Hey chat or summit, is the company that made this game linked to the WarZ/Romero's aftermath team?
[7:25:03] <GoofyHand> @gdkoopa just looking for attention lol
[7:25:05] <PhyuckPhace> chat asking if this is BR is making me feel old
[7:25:05] <gwooley> Gutocretto missed* Kappa

[7:25:34] <ysondoa> @dolphinxv nope
[7:25:35] <AAddiCTeD> idm the 3rd person, but i feel like 1st person servers would make this game even better
[7:25:35] <chopboneop> 762 Pog

[7:25:43] <awpulent> @Smackiing A) You're literally a plebian. B) People were in this chat not 4 hours ago lying and telling everyone that the game _was_ by the warZ devs and spreading lies.....
[7:25:44] <GrizzlyFiveM> @Ishney94 There is an ATV
[7:25:46] <iancad_> what do you do in this game?
[7:25:47] <TimHutch> no cars or crafting other than bandages

[7:26:16] <geiseric442> pick up melee @summit1g
[7:26:17] <CrowdControlRMRS> Looks about 100x worse that DayZ
[7:26:20] <gwooley> Gutocretto i was basically saying this is the new warz :D
[7:26:24] <TimHutch> no its to new imo
[7:26:24] <echodarkfire> Shame you’re missing taser tag on no pixel
[7:26:30] <gwooley> Ahh robot
[7:26:34] <gwooley> spooky
[7:26:36] <tideybot> How do you like the game so far? I really liked the WarZ feel it gave but I think it needs more content.
[7:26:36] <TimHutch> it has alot of potential
[7:26:40] <Celticspace> least the hit detection seemed nice on that
[7:26:41] <awefullyreal> @summit1g LUL you were told that earlier. You said "oh well. fuck it"
[7:26:41] <truetruer> they should have a small 1st person zone on map

[7:26:54] <tythemoose> I feel like fortntie is the only game that can pull off 3rd person and the games still look and feel good
[7:26:54] <djinnnn> crazy to think this was made by one person
[7:26:56] <dovakinconrad> @PlayXERA how long did it take you to make this game?
[7:26:56] <CantEvenSin> titles*
[7:26:56] <twjones> Man, my buddy said you killed me earlier. GG was a few hours ago I guess.
[7:27:00] <pandizzell> considering it was one person who made the game he didn't do to bad. none of you could do it

[7:27:19] <elitemav> @summit1g Will this be available on the Panasonic 3DO?
[7:27:21] <ryouko> @cantevensin, they're not the same devs
[7:27:22] <tideybot> @CantEvenSin No, it's a completely different studio and deved by only a few people.
[7:27:23] <callmeary> this game was made by one dude, inspired by the warz not affiliated @CantEvenSin

[8:30:06] <Dyess> @Vampses it feels like shit on all games if you have a 144hz monitor
[8:30:07] <Karnage_105> when i played in the stresstest i was getting 200+ fps, so it's something on summit's end
[8:30:07] <GoofyHand> i mean it looks fine to a viewer because we are all watching in 60 anyway but for the streamer it's terrible
[8:30:09] <AlbrightZ> if there is a "smooth fps" setting, turn it off
[8:30:11] <Pyromancer> One thing about WoW is when you push over 100 fps your OBS will start to stutter
[8:30:12] <oleskiy> He got a copy of WOW ?
[8:30:13] <cnk23> manual frame camp?
[8:30:21] <xcrispx> windowed fullscreen is locked at 60 fps no?

[8:31:03] <theblackrabb1t> The game is probably running off of integrated instead of GPU @Pyromancer rooThink that same thing happened to me.
[8:31:04] <Xionare> Google says nvidia refresh rate and new drivers idk if this helps
[8:31:08] <Karnage_105> @summit1g everythingi see says that you need to make sure the refresh rate is set to 144hz in nvidia control panel for the game. if it's not, the game will default to 60fps
