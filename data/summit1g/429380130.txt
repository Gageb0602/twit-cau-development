[3:46:17] <godlymikee> miss those phrases lol
[3:46:21] <EpicSCLive> @twofu_is_online I said that because it seems like there are some broken aspects in this game that make it difficult. like the lack of portal sounds and footsteps (complains ive heard from other streamers)
[3:46:22] <GypsonTV> Any CS:GO team out there to pracc? :D
[3:46:24] <Xenthorx> Looks incredible for F2P if you ask me
[3:46:25] <achzay> everyone has 100ping in this game
[3:46:28] <000_da_spine_rippah_000> the developers said they recorded the audio in a garage lol

[3:46:56] <joejitsu88> so basically pac-man portals? sweet!
[3:47:04] <Vitaceous> nice one man thanks how do you get them? looks like there's only the rail gun in FFA @CoinHiveLife
[3:47:05] <Xenthorx> UT4 with portals *
[3:47:05] <drvissmit> i would add some kind of Coodown Like recharge for the Portal thing if they put ranked game
[3:47:06] <SweetXxX> @achzay what you mean?
[3:47:12] <Nol166> it’s basically auto chess mixed with Mario brothers
[3:47:17] <costcospizza> why it like halo with portal tho
[3:47:19] <PReDaToRxFaZe> so basically no being a cop?
[3:47:20] <trent_zm> Looks pretty much like halo with deployable portals
[3:47:22] <000_da_spine_rippah_000> sumEZ
[3:47:27] <HazardousBC> why do people keep saying this is call of duty in space when its so heavily influenced by Halo lol

[7:25:41] <varona17> its because of the tuner guys, chill

[7:25:46] <Konntyy> he could crash murdaDC murdaDC
[7:25:47] <wimzy> he took the turn with 100+ mph and u went all the way down to 50. LUL the braking is whats the difference.
