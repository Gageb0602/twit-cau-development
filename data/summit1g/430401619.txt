[0:25:37] <cplb1tch> wtf is this trash?
[0:25:38] <Rwr70> @summit1g Essentially, theres a controversy about a player named Ceb, He said racist stuff about the russian community. This player, then downloaded like 25,000 replays of pub matches and found racist stuff that every player in the upcoming major said. Citing that everyone says racist shit and that its a bigger deal than we think.
[0:25:40] <AngrManagemnt> GTA? Just curious

[0:27:29] <Rwr70> @summit1g Essentially, theres a controversy about a player named Ceb, He said racist stuff about the russian community. This player, then downloaded like 25,000 replays of pub matches and found racist stuff that every player in the upcoming major said. Citing that everyone says racist shit and that its a bigger deal than we think.

[0:32:26] <Tonis015> 223 and 556 are basically the same thing
[0:32:26] <Shroomply> @rediyolo you know your guns?
[0:32:26] <hheemmpp> 223/556 is basically the same shit
[0:32:28] <Tornado> AK 556
[0:32:29] <RivalThreat> 223 is 5.56mm lol
[0:32:29] <DonutEatingBear> Payback time
[0:32:30] <AllReckless> shittiest ar on the planet if it cant shoot 556
[0:32:30] <christiano420> 223
[0:32:30] <prosaaxxx> llook at all the school shooters in chat with the gun knowledge Kappa

[0:32:32] <Vulgrim44> this looks like a good version of war z
[0:32:33] <bradan303> Gtaaa
[0:32:33] <i_hate_this_website> Single Fire SumSmash inc
[0:32:34] <iuventas> 556 is more powerful thats why you shouldnt shoot it out of 223 guns
[0:32:38] <fillynouch> @The_Red_Devil_666 its not a shop, its a stash
[0:32:38] <Tylxhh> Ar15 can use 226 and 556
[0:32:38] <ChknTendy> 556 nato is diff than 223
[0:32:38] <Recon_John> @The_Red_Devil_666 Because there wouldn't be anyone trying to sell shit in an apocolypse
[0:32:39] <lackofefforttv> ddepends on the barrel
[0:32:40] <krypticmello> chat is the global inv filled with unlimited of stuff???
[0:32:41] <IcedYoshi> @tano we have 4 oce servers running right now
[0:32:41] <ryanscott1030> single fire
[0:32:43] <lil_bow12> Change to full auto
[0:32:43] <axm2> 223 is different from 556 but ar15 can shoot both
[0:32:44] <theReal_McCoy> Def looking forward to getting ahold of it at some point! @IcedYoshi
[0:32:44] <pajamaman93> go get that ass @summit1g
[0:32:44] <jordymane> @lackofefforttv wylde would accept 5.56
[0:32:44] <BlackHeartMan> 223 is civilian equal to 5.56 nato- the gun is not as powerful as mil spec
[0:32:45] <tbcCroaker> whats the main difference with that game and WarZ anyone ?
[0:32:46] <BakuvirusTV> are your meds bound?
[0:32:46] <MejorPapi> whats the goal in this game? @summit1g
[0:32:47] <XryptiCipherX> nature sounds Kreygasm
[0:32:48] <acecobalt> @Majord5 Wrong, my ar is .556 and can also use 223
[0:32:49] <pdurty> AR's take both .223 and 5.56...but only an AR chambered in 5.56 can shoot both rounds...if the AR is chambered in .223 then it cant shoot 5.56
[0:32:51] <GreenDragun> shadows on low?
[0:32:51] <SealTeamFish> AR is 556 AND 223 its interchangeable
[0:32:52] <EverMeadow> What's .223 ammo?
[0:32:53] <WhatheGG> did the exp. reset?>
[0:32:53] <tartelon> single fire
[0:32:53] <desolate_ode> @lmao__21 not necessarily some guns chamber in both but not all 556 can take 223 vice versa
[0:32:54] <Dyess> @krypticmello No he has to bring that shit back

[0:55:14] <IcedYoshi> @nurfornuthin PubG utilizes the same assets from the UE store. It's common practice that helps speed development. A lot of store assets will be swapped out as we move through early access. We have a dedicated artist working on them (the ammo boxes for instance were one of the first ones swapped)

[1:38:09] <bozobonzai> @MrSilentNight Well if you played WarZ it had a similar leveling perk system thing. Yes It is like that though if that is something you most recently played. I imagine less customization because Division is more crafting your own build oriented with all the loot and stats in it
[1:38:10] <Anin209> myth is here PogChamp

[1:58:14] <vandarsin> @Richifornia no you can fire 223 out of 5.56 chamber but not the other way around that's why it's different
[1:58:15] <ReKoill> @summit1g Do you recommend this game for people who liked WarZ?
[1:58:17] <shadow_doggie> reduces 15 percent damage
[1:58:18] <theReal_McCoy> anything gets boring if you go above moderation @faderxero
[1:58:18] <lucid__paradise> @Dogspeonlegs why
[1:58:19] <Recon_John> @Corey2k ??? Bro, they're two different games completely, played entirely differently. If you want to watch EFT content, watch Pestily.

[3:12:02] <Artemis_Clydefrog> @TocinoBestia for sure, im a old school warz guy so seeing this is nostalgic
[3:12:04] <crazyamerican> if it becomes like warz then there will be third party websites to see and buy gear
[3:12:06] <IcedYoshi> @summit1g It's just a matter of time before people have a sniper or 2...........might be a while :P
[3:12:06] <ZenUltracrepidarians> monkaEyes
[3:12:07] <spartenk113> if there was like jug armor that would be sick
[3:12:08] <AnzuTakakura> this would be more fun if they add tons more of guns
[3:12:09] <crusader_csgo> @midgewa your head is too small for that Kappa

[3:50:30] <avdie> Ii like the storm audio it sounds legit
[3:50:31] <Gr1zzleybear> Yeah, Im gonna make the switch...I mean graphics wise the RTX with real time tracing isnt even use widley yet and dosn't make a big difference. So going with AMD and Radeon VII and its all around cheaper for the technology.
[3:50:32] <stonedgreatape> @IcedYoshi Lmao are you the dev
[3:50:33] <TheCreature17> i fucking love the bamby runs and then coming up on tons of loot

[4:12:37] <1Pun1> DayZ, Scum, Deadside, Dead Matter, now Xera all the same, you get a gun and run around.. SO little to involve the player.. We need a crafting/free build, open world, PVP game that isn't Ark or Rust.. Like a PUBG with base building / raiding..
[4:12:38] <Agitated_Ape> who is summit playing with?
[4:12:38] <TheKilllcams> @summit1g is there first person servers?
