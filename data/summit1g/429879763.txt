One driver drives up the entire map, switch drivers at the top and race back to the start. I think that'd be cool, seeing the route everyone takes. Maybe have some helpers sitting at locations on the way and having checkpoints you must pass through. Get something like that going man. @summit1g

[7:37:54] <Jordan88x> Did he do time for the attempted robbery guys?
[7:37:55] <z_r_0> so what you're saying is: I beat everyone in the GTR and so no one wants to race me in it, therefore I have no use for it
[7:37:56] <dylpicklev1> s15 going to be nerfed soon I feel
[7:37:57] <Bodgerton> the better car is the one you WANNA drive

[7:38:22] <kakester91> Since Colorado is basically Subaru World get the STI
[7:38:24] <zeroseoul> The evo and mitsubitshi didnt survive the economic downfall and the market for entry level sports cars was almost non existant. Subaru almost dropped the STI lineup and WRX around the same time.
[7:38:24] <ObviouslySmurfin> @z_r_0 he loses more races than he wins in the gtr, the sylvia is faster

[7:39:01] <soulkeeper425> jonelle said she would buy it off you.
[7:39:02] <shaffer> Dont you dare sell the GTR... you are the only person who owns the car you own IRL
[7:39:08] <o_Steel> @v1cev2 he already has an entry
[7:39:10] <gruta32> send me a message ill get you classic beta
[7:39:15] <johnny_gash> Didn't Sun Moon want a GTR before Vinny bought them all? He'd probably make a decent offer on it
[7:39:16] <ArmNHammer> it woulda been dope if they included the sti hatch
[7:39:17] <bannedmin01> @jesustheroadman yeah okay we're done here sorry for having an opinion
[7:39:21] <8unknown0> wtf
[7:39:22] <Grayballs> I think sum wants a car that's comparable to police vehicles so he can beat them with skill rather than just overpowering them. There's no fun in just obliterating them in 5 seconds.

[8:57:02] <nowayman> its very early on in develpopment
[8:57:02] <Stoke> you can go first person if you want
[8:57:03] <JohntheOGDon710> IT JUST CAME OUT
[8:57:03] <reeeidiculous> WHY would you play this when there is a drastically polished DayZ... like, wtf LUL
[8:57:04] <cakedup407> @deamonbackdb he is done with rp no more rip
[8:57:04] <Thicc_Quan> repetitive
[8:57:04] <klutchfour> @summit1g there is first and 3rd
[8:57:05] <JACKoSON42> same as every other fuck zombie game
[8:57:05] <reeeidiculous> @summit1g
[8:57:06] <vexytwitch> watch "Ready or Not" @summit1g

[8:57:07] <aRTeeCee> @summit1g Get in to Battalion, you can skirmish via Faceit like u do with csgo.
[8:57:08] <HeAngry> Guns are very findable, AK's and snipers are super rare
[8:57:10] <LillBooty> It's not only 3rd person, you can also first person @summit1g
[8:57:12] <AnthonyHomie69> very buggy
[8:57:12] <ash_ketchup3rd> Sea of thieves???
[8:57:13] <OGchuckgaming> SOT
[8:57:13] <influ_> It has 1st AND 3rd person??
[8:57:13] <Psychokiller70> Shroud said dayz better
[8:57:13] <Aa1777> nah forget that run some mindsweeper with me chief @summit1g
[8:57:14] <Cmoxxx> shroud called it a troll game
[8:57:14] <HeAngry> But the VSS is fucking nuts
[8:57:16] <dj_raekor> @summit1g the lags are real.
[8:57:20] <Partylan> like you shoot and a second later the bullet hits
[8:57:20] <GoofyHand> there was created by 1 guy alone so great for 1 guy but not going to get better soon
[8:57:20] <L0UDMOUTH> Its not only first person. just pretty buggy and only One Dev
[8:57:22] <Stoke> awm and vss
[8:57:23] <Murfhy> shroud slayed on it earlier
[8:57:23] <JohntheOGDon710> VSS

[8:57:24] <HydraCide> l96 and vss
[8:57:24] <MeltingPopsicle_> you can spawn too close to where you die
[8:57:24] <Blorp> it lacks salad dressing
[8:57:25] <douglass8416> Apex?
[8:57:25] <JaxxRyan> Complete crap
[8:57:26] <influ_> Yeah, snipers are very rare
[8:57:26] <thedwag27x1> First/Third person button. Choco taco played.
[8:57:27] <Stellerex> You need a SNES to play this @summit1g
[8:57:29] <GothicDoll> 900R is totally different car
[8:57:30] <AUSKitto> The same as every other zombie survival game out there
[8:57:30] <klutchfour> @summit1g yes there are 4 rare guns
[8:57:30] <scotty2time> It really is trash to be honest. Been watching shroud

[8:57:34] <reeeidiculous> Why would you play this over DayZ? like literally why LUL @summit1g
[8:57:34] <thecrazzyness> @summit1g basically you loot then fight until you die and go loot again. Loot is super abundant though

[9:11:22] <Geemz> squad is arma + battlefield
[9:11:23] <viper23achalpha1> its a very good military sim
[9:11:23] <Bodgerton> it's got a steep learning cxurve, and if you dont like dealing with other people who dont listen to you, it its tedious
[9:11:25] <taruzavarftw> please play ark by wildcard
[9:11:25] <nowayman> u can just run around with a gun yeah
[9:11:25] <chubbyepic> damn.. i love tanks :D

[9:12:50] <viper23achalpha1> Infantry is the branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot, distinguished from cavalry, artillery, and tank forces. Also known as foot soldiers, infantry traditionally relies on moving by foot between combats as well, but may also use mounts, military vehicles, or other transport.
