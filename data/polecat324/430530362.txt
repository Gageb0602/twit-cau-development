[0:23:21] <r0wdyriley> @whatmuppet because everyone asks about them?
[0:23:22] <kylar8900125> Shoot it in the weak spot
[0:23:27] <Guns0369> Get close enough until it "deploys," then shoot the blue part near the center. Each time the sentry "charges up," take cover behind something or else you'll be hit almost immediately and take tons of damage. It will also occasionally send out electric shockwaves that you must jump over (or duck under).
