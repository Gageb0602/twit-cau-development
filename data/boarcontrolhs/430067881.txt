[0:03:52] <Wrigglyz> moon2AY good luck later
[0:04:11] <Kunizial2> hmm, how you're feeling about facing bozzzton today? easy 2-0?
[0:04:17] <Wrigglyz> moon2D im not a big fan of specialist but all the GM streaming is good for hearthstone
[0:04:30] <Kunizial2> ofc no way you'd ever loose a single game of hearthstone
[0:04:35] <Wrigglyz> twitch total viewers goes way up during the GM games
[0:04:46] <Wrigglyz> & brings in new playesrs and itnerest
[0:05:38] <Kunizial2> idk, playhearthstone still had less viewers than faker and riotgames at their na collegue games yesterday
[0:05:47] <Blastoise> Hi boar :)
[0:06:11] <Kunizial2> still a good number of viewers though
[0:06:14] <Wrigglyz> moon2XD
[0:07:07] <Wrigglyz> i wish blizz used the decktracker plugin on their streams that shows what cards do when u hover over them
[0:07:21] <Wrigglyz> we take it for granted that we know what the cards do but new people have no idea
[0:07:49] <Kunizial2> not really, but at least the collogue games don't feel particularly fancy to me, and i'm only picking those two cause those are the two i streams i follow and were live at the same time
[0:08:07] <SkizzenRL> yo everyone, hows it going?
[0:08:16] <Wrigglyz> moon2AY
[0:08:58] <Kunizial2> i'm aware that some big streamer have more views even while the same game has big games going on, so it's not particularly well to compare anyway

[0:10:04] <ziggythegr8> EU>NA?
[0:10:12] <prollyRS> what was the best card of this expansion and why is it conjurer's call? :)
[0:10:29] <prollyRS> pepeJAM
[0:10:33] <Kunizial2> i also only know cause my player kept crashing so i had to reopen it multiple times through the matches
[0:11:00] <ziggythegr8> everyone knows that best card is credit carad
[0:11:03] <ziggythegr8> card*
[0:11:24] <Kunizial2> credit card = CC, conjurer's calling = CC, carnivorous cube = CC
[0:11:26] <jotpewarjat> @BoarControlHS yo, how do you feel vs mech hunter ? mech hunter have more then 60% vs cyclon mage ?

[0:21:44] <Wrigglyz> moon2SMAG once i went out drinking in london and fell asleep on the train home and was woken up by the cleaner at 3am
[0:22:03] <IdanProK> lul
[0:22:11] <Kunizial2> i don't drink so i dodge that specific scenario
[0:22:16] <Wrigglyz> he was like WAKEY WAKEY moon2DUMB
[0:23:34] <Kunizial2> but i woke up just a bit too late once, last drive of the bus for the day, and he was just driving away from the last station (which was where i leave) so it wasn't too bad, just felt pretty awkward
[0:24:01] <Wrigglyz> moon2XD
[0:24:19] <xadafarus> beware he has Reno in hand BibleThump
[0:24:25] <CharString88> LOL That has happened to me so often

[0:25:17] <Wrigglyz> moon2O
[0:25:31] <Vanguard187> Gey rige?
[0:25:43] <Kunizial2> he can see most places from the front, i just sat at one of the few blind spots, and at worst the end isn't too far away
[0:26:00] <CharString88> Yeah. Depends on the driver.. Some will wake you at the last stop. Some will wake you in the garage.
[0:26:29] <Paradox__HS> Thijs? SeemsGood
[0:26:40] <Kunizial2> depending on the driver standing up at the last stop is additional "workout" DansGame
[0:26:40] <Paradox__HS> This is literally a cringe-off right now LUL
[0:26:43] <Kunizial2> or at least effort

[1:08:08] <NPJawZ> def live together for a couple years first I would say.. :o
[1:08:35] <Kiixxx> no Kappa
[1:08:40] <Wrigglyz> moon2T never heard of it
[1:09:17] <Wrigglyz> moon2T better nerf cards from the boomsday project but not touch zilliax which is in like 50% of decks
[1:09:30] <novasae> OMEGALUL misplay
[1:09:30] <Iron_Llama_42> Sort of a test run, sort of see if it works at the next step. Also you are young and all the stages in a long term relationship are fun. Don't skip if you dont have to
[1:09:35] <rumumyum> missed lethal LUL
[1:09:36] <ZeppMan217> Zilliax is goo tho
[1:09:39] <Wrigglyz> moon2T better not buff emp operative

[1:11:09] <Wrigglyz> moon2WAH 📣 L2P
[1:12:20] <quote_if_TOMMY_309> @iron_llama_42 thanks man :D it has been pretty smooth for her and i so far, bit scary but i have a feeling it will come natural
[1:12:31] <Ishaan96s> Is this better than midrange?
[1:12:32] <Zordob> Boring deck imo
[1:13:41] <ZeppMan217> it's not boring at all
[1:13:58] <Kjisu> you played well yesterday boar, we are proud of you :)
[1:14:06] <ZeppMan217> warrior is boring, where you just remove everything from the board every turn, especially after Boom
[1:14:51] <Zordob> Zilliax op
[1:14:54] <akumaker> Where is this list from boar
[1:15:03] <novasae> @akumaker senf
[1:15:03] <ZeppMan217> from senf's twitter
[1:15:04] <Wrigglyz> MindManners in 50% of decks defenitely balanced guys better not nerf
[1:15:30] <Zordob> gg reno
[1:16:02] <akumaker> I lost to revenge of the wild DansGame
[1:16:06] <Wrigglyz> moon2O nvm i just checked, Zilliax is in 60% of decks now
[1:17:43] <Wrigglyz> moon2D the problem with zilliax is that it is op when magnetised
[1:18:02] <yolokappaswag> @boarcontrolhs f2p btw
[1:18:09] <Wrigglyz> and its still good enough to be in rogue and mage which have no mechs and dont use the magnetise at all

[1:37:29] <Wrigglyz> i think game design wise defile was my fave card
[1:37:56] <Wrigglyz> cos it rewarded skill and could be played around
[1:37:59] <Jakaso27> Spirit of the shark

[1:39:36] <Remlosh> boarSnap
[1:39:41] <Jakaso27> Boar remember when u could play otk palla and holy wrath pala
[1:39:50] <Jakaso27> Or quest rogue or maly druid
[1:39:55] <StreamElements> Join BoarControl's Animal Farm! https://discordapp.com/invite/boarcontrol
[1:39:58] <Jakaso27> Or mechathun warlock
[1:40:05] <baratolo__> @BoarControlHS what were the odds of that knife juggler lethal?
[1:40:11] <Jakaso27> And u complain about not being able to go mole into razormaw
[1:40:14] <FudoV> mechathun is the worst dsign mstae
[1:40:20] <FudoV> in the history of hs
[1:40:21] <FudoV> after barnes
[1:40:37] <Jakaso27> How fudo
[1:40:39] <Jakaso27> How
[1:40:56] <FudoV> it made combo decks degenerate
[1:41:01] <fermee> Just concede against entity :)
[1:41:02] <FudoV> mechacthun type of combodecks
[1:41:03] <Jakaso27> ??????
[1:41:06] <Jakaso27> ???????????
[1:41:07] <FudoV> are most degenate
[1:41:17] <Jakaso27> Why
[1:41:22] <FudoV> when you vry rarely can use your combo piece for tempo
[1:41:29] <FudoV> and just cycle trough deck
[1:41:33] <Jakaso27> So what
[1:41:51] <Kiixxx> thank good its getting buffed.. oh wait
[1:41:51] <PapaKurri> good morning
[1:41:57] <FudoV> it makes deck pilot make less decisisons
[1:41:59] <FudoV> which is bad
[1:42:01] <Jakaso27> That’s such a bad argument
[1:42:05] <FudoV> wdym
[1:42:05] <Jakaso27> Holy shut
[1:42:12] <FudoV> bad argument
[1:42:45] <CrankyPanda> if you auto mcthundecks, you probably misplay
[1:42:59] <Jakaso27> Ur telling me you’d rather play vs someone who goes mole razormaw than someone who draws 2 crystology
[1:43:01] <FudoV> you want to encourage decision making from your players
[1:43:24] <Jakaso27> Boar I’m on phone give me a sec to type
[1:43:35] <Jakaso27> ???????
[1:43:36] <FudoV> there are playable 4 drops
[1:43:40] <FudoV> but problem is
[1:43:43] <Professor_Piranha> sandbinder lol
[1:43:44] <FudoV> mastr call is too broken
[1:43:45] <novasae> houndmaster shaw is a playable 4 drop Pog
[1:43:47] <Jakaso27> U literally just said u missed curving with mid hunter
[1:43:49] <FudoV> so you are restricted to beasts
[1:43:56] <Jakaso27> Literally just contradicted yourself
[1:44:00] <92Tommy> @BoarControlHS giant
[1:44:03] <Jayjajy> If you want a 4 drop just play Chillwind Yeti FailFish

[1:44:59] <novasae> murloc tastyhfin hench clan hag
[1:45:08] <novasae> PogChamp dark iron dwarf
[1:45:20] <FudoV> its because bord clears
[1:45:23] <FudoV> are too powerful
[1:45:31] <FudoV> so it discorags people from playing curbve decks
[1:45:32] <SirVilgaudas> monkaHmm
[1:45:38] <fermee> Is there a defile clear Kappa
[1:45:44] <seangoku11> is harrison still worth running? since the rogue nerf theres actually not that manny weapons anymore and harrison is mostly a wasted tech
[1:45:47] <Jakaso27> Lol what fudo
[1:45:50] <SMukha> Go zoo
[1:45:51] <FudoV> like just delete warrior
[1:45:53] <CrankyPanda> which classes except warrior and pala have clears?
[1:45:54] <FudoV> from the game
[1:45:58] <FudoV> and it become bettr
[1:46:02] <adc_is_supp_diff> what board clears are u talking about lol
[1:46:02] <fermee> @seangoku11 he belongs in a museum
[1:46:03] <FudoV> becomes
[1:46:05] <ElectricLawnMower> @seangoku11, this is vs warrior
[1:46:10] <fermee> Nova doom Pog
[1:46:12] <Jakaso27> The past 3 metas the best decks have been hunter rogue and mid hunter
[1:46:18] <FudoV> ys
[1:46:21] <FudoV> past metas were goo
[1:46:23] <FudoV> good
[1:46:28] <FudoV> midhunter meta
[1:46:31] <Jakaso27> ?????
[1:46:33] <FudoV> was the best in last year
[1:46:41] <Jakaso27> It literally is mid hunter meta right now
[1:46:43] <lulzbuot> @BoarControlHS why are people cutting rabble bouncers now?
[1:46:45] <ntRtainment> I never play the second banana here
[1:46:49] <fermee> You think the rexxar mini game was ideal?
[1:46:57] <FudoV> but it diffrent midhunter
[1:46:59] <FudoV> its
[1:47:02] <seangoku11> yea but even warrior plays only the 2/3 weapon with 6 armor which is not a big deal PLUS sometimes you cant even play him because your hand is too full already and you'd overdraw by playing harrison
[1:47:04] <Wrigglyz> starM best meta was when i could play tempo mage
[1:47:06] <FudoV> people woudl call it conrol hunter
[1:47:10] <Jakaso27> Boar loved rexxar and dire mole razormaw
[1:47:14] <Jakaso27> That’s all I’m hearing
[1:47:15] <FudoV> if it was ibn naxx or something
[1:47:23] <FudoV> i miss dire mole
[1:47:28] <FudoV> raormaw not so much
[1:47:44] <Wrigglyz> moon2XD i though dire mole was classic for ages
[1:47:57] <Wrigglyz> when it rotated i was like wat??? starP
[1:48:15] <Professor_Piranha> lmfao those 3 drops
[1:48:16] <Jakaso27> I miss there being cards that were somewhat powerful
[1:48:20] <ntRtainment> these are not minions hunterace would roll, boar
[1:48:23] <Jakaso27> And decks that were powerful
[1:48:25] <StreamElements> BoarControl is now on Youtube! For stream highlights and guides subscribe! https://goo.gl/XBMNoi
[1:48:28] <ntRtainment> hunterace always rolls 3/5s, 5/5s or 4/7s
[1:48:38] <Jakaso27> Now there’s only like 3 good cards in the game
[1:48:51] <fermee> What is the 3/5 possible roll?
[1:48:58] <ntRtainment> the turtle thingy
[1:49:02] <ntRtainment> that deals 5 to your own face
[1:49:07] <fermee> Ah right
[1:49:10] <ntRtainment> the card ike hard ran in his token druid
[1:49:18] <FudoV> idk jakaso
[1:49:23] <tjesimir86> @BoarControlHS will mage still be Tier 1 after buffs release?
[1:49:24] <FudoV> i think powrlevel of the game is too high
[1:49:25] <StreamElements> Follow BoarControl for decklists and updates on tournaments! https://twitter.com/BoarControl
[1:49:26] <CrankyPanda> why do we trade like that?
[1:49:30] <FudoV> the closer game to arena the better

[1:49:43] <CrankyPanda> giving khadgar away instead of imp
[1:49:50] <fermee> Why did you trade off the khadgar instead of the imp
[1:49:56] <hunteracehs> Which makes power cards to broken
[1:49:57] <Fd1201> @Fd1201 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[1:50:11] <FudoV> there are 2 solutions for that
[1:50:13] <MaN_with_a_VaN> LULW ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 🔧 TwitchVotes Hassan: Wait, this isnt Artifact, Im gonna have to ban you
[1:50:17] <Jakaso27> That’s what I’m saying hunterace
[1:50:24] <FudoV> we had kft
[1:50:32] <FudoV> now let us have meta with no powerful cards
[1:50:37] <Jakaso27> Fudo did u really say “the closer game to arena the better”
[1:50:38] <FudoV> when we can yeti on 4
[1:50:40] <FudoV> and be happy
[1:50:43] <Jakaso27> Wtf
[1:50:44] <FudoV> yes
[1:50:48] <ntRtainment> boar why didnt you do the next level play of pinging your own minion
[1:50:48] <Zordob> gg kid
[1:51:12] <Jakaso27> There’s a reason that way more people play constructed than arena
[1:51:15] <Wrigglyz> moon2XD boar you are playing too early in teh morning
[1:51:23] <Wrigglyz> brain takes time to get going
[1:51:26] <Jakaso27> Arena is repetitive and boring
[1:51:37] <FudoV> because balance is bad
[1:51:38] <fermee> arenas full, beat it
[1:51:53] <Zordob> Yes, very
[1:51:54] <Wrigglyz> moon2XD i cant tell if u playin gbadly or not
[1:51:56] <regulator327> you are just getting all your losses out of the way before gm Kappa
[1:52:05] <Jakaso27> Ur playing badly @boarcontrolhs
[1:52:07] <Jakaso27> :)
[1:52:12] <fermee> The shire has its own hearthstone server? But it’s so small
[1:52:20] <N0toriousDim> always lose PepeHands
[1:52:21] <ntRtainment> who are you playing today?
[1:52:24] <Iron_Llama_42> LIttle tilted?
[1:52:25] <FudoV> constructed is boring when you dont need to change gameplan accroding to situatinon
[1:52:29] <Zordob> Traded khadgar for no reason = bad play 🤷🏻♂️
[1:52:31] <FudoV> and your deck operates always the same
[1:52:34] <N0toriousDim> today is the day boar! i believe!
[1:52:36] <FudoV> e.g mechatchun deck
[1:52:42] <FudoV> or control(nonbomb) warrior
[1:52:49] <ntRtainment> oh its the freewin matchup
[1:52:52] <fermee> Boar is 0-3 so far in gm right? Still time to recover
[1:53:02] <SuperbiSqualo1> no way this is correct
[1:53:09] <FudoV> @fermee no relegaton this season its fine 4Head
[1:53:23] <FudoV> he farming cimeback stry for season 2
[1:53:23] <fermee> How many games are there in gm? Idk how the structure even works- are there playoffs?
[1:53:45] <Jakaso27> I mean ur dumb if u think those decks never change gameplan
[1:54:00] <Zordob> Boar worse than fulham
[1:54:01] <FudoV> they do but too rarely
[1:54:25] <Iron_Llama_42> I think GM would be a little with baseball scoring - each game won is counted. You get something for a 2-1 instead of thing for a 2-1. Always play 3 games.
[1:54:26] <Jakaso27> Also didn’t u just complain about mid hunter being too slow
[1:54:30] <Iron_Llama_42> *little better
[1:54:47] <Jakaso27> Insinuating u want mid hunter to be on the just go face and kill them plan all the time
[1:54:48] <regulator327> boar has to do a cersei lannister style walk of shame if he comes bottom of gm Kappa
[1:55:01] <Wrigglyz> starBaka
[1:55:02] <FudoV> i am saying old midhunter was perfect deck
[1:55:08] <FudoV> and new is not
[1:55:09] <Jakaso27> ????
[1:55:09] <hobo009> RAY 2/2
[1:55:15] <Jakaso27> i am saying old midhunter was perfect deck
[1:55:19] <Jakaso27> LUL
[1:55:21] <FudoV> lik midhunter or midshaman in totem golem era
[1:55:29] <FudoV> thats decks what i want to see in hearthstone
[1:55:35] <fermee> Why not ray to test? Are we saving it for giants
[1:55:37] <FudoV> and not double brawl crap or draw my deck crap
[1:56:15] <eDead> I just dropped from legend 600 to legend 2000, can't remember what it feels like to win
[1:56:23] <Zordob> @boarcontrolhs whats for lunch?
[1:56:31] <Jakaso27> So ur telling me razormaw and rexxar are good well designed cards
[1:56:34] <Jakaso27> Hmmmmmmmm
[1:56:44] <FudoV> no i dont
[1:56:53] <Jakaso27> How
[1:56:55] <FudoV> but they were significantly more fine for meta wth dks
[1:56:59] <Zordob> @afjhdsfhajsdhf 🖕
[1:57:05] <FudoV> than some of the cards for current meta
[1:57:29] <stevend3942> frostbolt your own giant to test for spellbender

[1:58:10] <FudoV> we can use drawn winrates
[1:58:15] <FudoV> on hsreplay

[1:58:38] <Wrigglyz> moon2AY perfect
[1:58:58] <eDead> probably Kappa
[1:59:14] <ntRtainment> it looks like a win
[1:59:22] <ntRtainment> how does that deck kill 2 mountain giants
[1:59:24] <Zordob> EleGiggle
[1:59:39] <Zordob> Do u play in gm today?

[2:00:56] <Draftbeer> LUL
[2:00:57] <ntRtainment> ok we lost
[2:00:57] <kanelsnurr> Jebaited
[2:01:00] <CrankyPanda> it looks like a loss
[2:01:05] <eustacemaximus> "SKILL"
[2:01:09] <Wrigglyz> moon2XD fitting song
[2:01:10] <fermee> Mct is a balanced card
[2:01:25] <Khzfan> Too far behind to play around mct anyway
[2:01:30] <Kiixxx> people playing MCT again so its so annoying
[2:01:33] <FudoV> i love how they removed it from arena with reasoning "feelsbad to play against"
[2:01:34] <ntRtainment> imagine if it was barrier
[2:01:38] <CrankyPanda> didnt we have khadgar outs?
[2:01:38] <FudoV> and didnt do it with constructed
[2:01:49] <ntRtainment> what if it was barrier, boar
[2:01:50] <Wrigglyz> MCT is good now mage has wideboard of big stuff all the time
[2:02:09] <Draftbeer> your mom EleGiggle
[2:02:14] <Zordob> L merchant
[2:02:14] <ntRtainment> actually Ill go check his vod
[2:02:24] <pepoClown_HonkHonk> Draftbeer Got'em 😂
[2:02:25] <ntRtainment> hes streaming
[2:02:34] <fermee> Every other secret would have been better than barrier, no way it was barrier
[2:02:46] <ntRtainment> it was vape
[2:02:51] <fermee> Oh but it was off cyclone right
[2:02:54] <ntRtainment> we gucci
[2:03:03] <fermee> Or the dragon priestess
[2:03:14] <Draftbeer> VapeNation
[2:03:17] <ntRtainment> it's not THAt unreasonable to pick 8 armor
[2:03:24] <ntRtainment> Im sure there are worse options
[2:03:24] <StreamElements> BoarControl is now on Youtube! For stream highlights and guides subscribe! https://goo.gl/XBMNoi
[2:03:36] <ntRtainment> 8 armor makes you do a lot of shit to play around it
[2:03:47] <FudoV> @BoarControlHS whats better: river croc or raorfen raptor in mag sideboard for midrange hunter
[2:03:54] <CrankyPanda> paying 3 mana for that isnt too great
[2:03:55] <Wrigglyz> moon2AY Boar what time is your GM game today
[2:04:14] <Draftbeer> ded btw
[2:04:20] <FudoV> *in hunter sideboard for mge
[2:04:32] <Wrigglyz> i cant find a scehdule
[2:04:42] <TerminusFive> started playing this deck recently Frost Nova seems like it's over performing
[2:04:50] <Zordob> @fudov FailFish
[2:05:04] <FudoV> @Zordob checked yaytears
[2:05:11] <FudoV> and a lot of performing huters in last open cups
[2:05:12] <Zordob> @fudov Wot
[2:05:14] <Protaras> Protaras subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! What is that zetalot priest deck like?
[2:05:15] <Wodan212> @wrigglyz 21:00 CEST
[2:05:16] <FudoV> run bloodfen raptor
[2:05:26] <FudoV> in sideboard
[2:05:47] <Draftbeer> what is priest
[2:05:50] <Khzfan> The wolf is destroying you
[2:05:52] <Protaras> the burn one he posted on twitter.
[2:05:53] <Draftbeer> 🤔
[2:06:10] <CrankyPanda> i dont think zeta got legend yet so prob not too hot
[2:06:13] <Zordob> You know that one zetalot priest deck? Yeah that one
[2:06:13] <kanelsnurr> EZ
[2:06:47] <CrankyPanda> zetaFeels
[2:06:49] <regulator327> playing zeta's decks is good if you want to get to 5 digit legend Kappa
[2:06:52] <ntRtainment> just roll doomsayer, boar
[2:07:00] <FudoV> @BoarControlHS can we win a game pls
[2:07:07] <shagura1980> boar you think extra arms will help priest to comeback or not?
[2:07:24] <FoodForWyrms> doomsayer sucks
[2:07:30] <beepbeepbeep3> pepeJAM
[2:07:31] <ntRtainment> straight into the murloc shaman
[2:07:34] <Khzfan> Needed cyclone on 2
[2:07:39] <noodlekuba> where is Shire
[2:07:41] <fermee> Maybe nova or barrier instead of rabble bouncer that turn? But maybe wouldn’t have made a diff
[2:07:43] <noodlekuba> hi boar
[2:07:55] <lulzbuot> doomsayer only sucks vs warrior?
[2:08:07] <Wrigglyz> OSFrog mrrrgggl
[2:08:34] <fermee> If I were playing non murloc shaman I would always use morgl for the mulligan fake
[2:08:36] <primelhs> isnt snap freeze just a worse frostbolt?
[2:08:38] <ntRtainment> this is fine
[2:09:14] <HumpZHS> I think we should lose everygame on ladder today and win masters boarSnap
[2:09:16] <Wrigglyz> moon2AY aww
[2:09:19] <noodlekuba> i love your playlist today
[2:09:35] <boarwa> can luna be replaced?

[2:11:48] <FudoV> WE WON A GAME

[2:30:47] <Paradox__HS> if you go for the 3rd giant you risk soulfire bs being lethal
[2:31:03] <Paradox__HS> Or yeah leeroy is lethal now too
[2:31:08] <CrankyPanda> bananas pin is 27
[2:31:08] <Nik134_> lethal next turn with bananas
[2:31:14] <Draftbeer> leeroy lethal

[2:32:33] <N0toriousDim> he missed 1 dmg :(
[2:32:37] <Cnoko> flashbacks from yesterday PepeHands
[2:32:44] <CrankyPanda> 2 giants wins less times i think

[2:38:55] <Bayre3> he probably meant thunderhead
[2:39:10] <TerminusFive> 6 hp thunderhead gonna be nuts though
[2:39:11] <CrankyPanda> tbh thunderhead isnt op. it needs a buff
[2:39:15] <Rivys> the Slyssa list is really good and can beat warrior

[3:23:46] <Fausje> Wow that's pretty rigged
[3:23:48] <WilmsHS> Pathra even admitted to being one of the less good players. It's just sad that people call her out for being a woman like this, it's so unneccesary
[3:23:52] <Cnoko> does performance in season 1 matter in s2?

[3:24:17] <Stewie443> btw I hate the condition that players are not allowed to stream during their region's GM
[3:24:20] <iRainyLives> @WilmsHS she is getting called not because a woman because she makes bad plays even casters said it today
[3:24:29] <FudoV> but saying its bcsue she is woman is stupid
[3:24:31] <Stewie443> such a shitty practise by Blizzard
[3:24:31] <Chaozhax> but atleast pathra is hot, no other gm is hot, not even boar KappaPride
[3:24:38] <FudoV> problem is representation policy
[3:24:39] <SMukha> @irainylives agreed.
[3:24:41] <FudoV> it should not exist
[3:24:45] <ierogliff> I must admit, from all the GM casters so far, Brian Kibler was by far least annoying. SeemsGood
[3:24:45] <WilmsHS> @iRainyLives Chat was full of "back to the kitchen" comments. That's just sad
[3:24:51] <Cnoko> @iRainyLives i'm pretty sure chat just says stuff like "woman LULW "
[3:24:54] <FudoV> just do it for deserving people no amtter what race or gender they are
[3:25:04] <iRainyLives> well twitch chat is 13 years old

[3:25:11] <WilmsHS> I agree that she played bad, it's just sad that chat was so misogynist
[3:25:13] <FudoV> would be better
[3:25:20] <SMukha> @wilmshs it really wasn’t man. I dunno why you’re exaggerating it, most people were saying it was misplays

[3:25:58] <SMukha> Go cut off your nuts
[3:26:03] <hotgrillxd> White males op
[3:26:05] <N0toriousDim> Is this how it works? monkaThink
[3:26:06] <Toffi_____> so scared of white males : P
[3:26:06] <FoodForWyrms> still should not be a GM
[3:26:08] <brain_rot> white card game players the scariest bunch
[3:26:15] <s3rsetin> @BoarControlHS your right here
[3:26:16] <FudoV> idk
[3:26:16] <SMukha> Boar so intimidating wauw
[3:26:16] <calderon78i> EZ
[3:26:16] <FireHS> it's intresting asking why that happend in the 1st place
[3:26:22] <Timpietim> LUL
[3:26:23] <FudoV> if everyone was a balck girl
[3:26:28] <jesuis1> what a skilled turn
[3:26:29] <FudoV> i would not be scared
[3:26:37] <ntRtainment> why didnt that guy leave after you played boom
[3:26:38] <Cnoko> i'm not into fighting games because those are for black people. please dont ban me
[3:26:39] <Stewie443> she's a gm because she's popular
[3:26:44] <iRainyLives> LUL
[3:26:49] <N0toriousDim> decent 4 mana 4/1 deal 14 monkaThink
[3:26:51] <TerminusFive> @ierogliff yeah but he hasn't been relevant for a while iirc whereas Navi even won a major tourney last year
[3:26:51] <iRainyLives> true that
[3:27:06] <TerminusFive> @ierogliff it just strikes as odd to me
[3:27:12] <khalamor> will more people be added to GM after season 1?
[3:27:13] <Fausje> No, gamers are obviously the most oppressed people in society, get with the times man Kappa
[3:27:19] <FireHS> yeah I guess the only people sad enogth to sit at their pc and play a child's card game all day is white males LUL
[3:27:20] <iRainyLives> well we had some african american streamers who were good at standard but they are all gone
[3:27:24] <FudoV> @TerminusFive strifecro was from "objective" money spit

[3:28:17] <Cnoko> LUL
[3:28:18] <ierogliff> @terminusfive As Blizzard themselves told us, recent competitive achievements wasn't the only one criteria.
[3:28:35] <FireHS> And tbf twitch chat is terrible I still remember when terrance was on a big stream really kinda put me off the community in general a bit
[3:28:36] <ToastmonsterHS> how many weeks of swiss is gm?
[3:28:41] <TerminusFive> fair enough
[3:28:52] <baldeaglexx> Good job doing that thing that you did LUL
[3:28:55] <iPoliticLOL> Rogue has secrets?
[3:28:56] <FudoV> @ToastmonsterHS its round robin
[3:28:59] <ToastmonsterHS> oh its round robin not swiss anyway
[3:29:00] <iRainyLives> blizzard picked for gm mostly poster boys who are streaming
[3:29:14] <ToastmonsterHS> that's a yikes lol

[3:30:38] <novasae> monkaS missing arcane giant so much they play mountain giant

[3:32:11] <Fausje> Mcthun
[3:32:16] <FudoV> @BoarControlHS elysiana is not in the deck and it could be correct
[3:32:25] <kruchnicxd> is elysiana good in this deck? @boarcontrolhs
[3:32:25] <FudoV> @BoarControlHS you are missing cairne and grom tho which is unacceptable
[3:32:36] <alwaysonedmgoff> you missed the 1 mana card that discovers mechs
[3:32:37] <ToastmonsterHS> well there's some people who aren't ever getting relegated
[3:32:40] <calderon78i> no relegation - just like NA leagues naviJammies
[3:32:42] <ntRtainment> fudov why arent you sleeping
[3:32:58] <FudoV> @BoarControlHS oh ye no assembly LUL
[3:33:11] <CaRuJa_> if the sample size is too small to get relagted then its too small to have a winner :/
[3:33:17] <FudoV> @ntRtainment pathra mattch kept me too excites
[3:33:17] <ToastmonsterHS> like you think they're booting thijs out for the top money earner from 3 random tour stops?
[3:33:20] <FudoV> excited
[3:33:21] <kruchnicxd> no elysiana? why
[3:33:24] <StreamElements> BoarControl is now on Youtube! For stream highlights and guides subscribe! https://goo.gl/XBMNoi
[3:33:42] <ToastmonsterHS> no he won't be though
[3:33:49] <ToastmonsterHS> even if they carry on
[3:33:56] <ToastmonsterHS> you don't guarantee an invite from being the money earner
[3:33:59] <ToastmonsterHS> you MIGHT get an invite
[3:34:04] <innocheung> Does town crier draw mech minions after boom?
[3:34:12] <brain_rot> no it doesnt
[3:34:13] <exigens> relegate top streamer from your advertising
[3:34:14] <Werster_stole_my_bike> Hello TPFufun
[3:34:23] <calderon78i> LUL
[3:34:29] <brain_rot> it has to have rush written on the card
[3:34:40] <FireHS> I swear if that happens it'll be so dumb
[3:34:41] <Stewie443> Im surprised Thijs agreed to play on GM
[3:34:45] <ToastmonsterHS> surely then it would say will get an invite
[3:34:52] <ToastmonsterHS> its the invite that says might
[3:34:53] <FireHS> Like if your relegated you should be relegated
[3:34:59] <ntRtainment> pretty sure thijs enjoys competing
[3:35:01] <Stewie443> I guess he doesnt lose much of his stream hours
[3:35:05] <Stewie443> he does yea
[3:35:16] <ToastmonsterHS> well they've never changed their mind on systems with no notice before
[3:35:17] <FireHS> And i swear if they count gm league as money making it'd be very dumb
[3:35:22] <ToastmonsterHS> so yeah that's probably a good point of trust
[3:35:27] <brain_rot> its free exposure
[3:35:32] <brain_rot> grows his channel more
[3:35:54] <calderon78i> how many views does gm get
[3:35:58] <FudoV> boar just preared for everything
[3:36:18] <TerminusFive> EU and na get around 20-25k

[3:37:17] <phoenix1386> probably a bunch of artifact sponsors or something PepeLaugh

[3:37:23] <novasae> artifact is just illegal streams 4Head
[3:37:26] <DeantyThe2nd> PepeLaugh
[3:37:32] <actuated69> people were just streaming movies and other non artifact things
[3:37:36] <Stewie443> there were probably 5 real people and bots
[3:37:37] <ntRtainment> flurry is farming points on my fantasy team
[3:37:38] <iRainyLives> artifact would be a good game if they introduced that game with different paying system

[3:41:32] <sutikshna> @BoarControlHS bye the way does bomb warrior beat mage as gm resutts show
[3:41:34] <casie1> 2018 format was so sick
[3:41:39] <alwaysonedmgoff> ^
[3:41:46] <Draftbeer> 4th angler
[3:41:50] <ziggythegr8> forever reload
[3:41:51] <Draftbeer> OMEGALUL
[3:41:51] <Ampzyh> i really dont understand what is going on with HS this year
[3:41:52] <calderon78i> infinte anglers Pog
[3:41:52] <raiden_tv1> yo is this deck worth dusting elysiana to make it? i need to choose one, bomb or control, what would you recommend @BoarControlHS
[3:41:59] <iRainyLives> im hoping that they will go back so the conquest format cause its rly boring to watch 2 same decks per match
[3:41:59] <Stewie443> dunno gm is boring so far for me
[3:42:10] <iRainyLives> its good for players but cmon its boring to watch
[3:42:11] <sutikshna> @BoarControlHS yess this is an every elitist approach to the game
[3:42:12] <FireHS> I feel like they could have modified the last year format to have weekly online games somehow idk surely that would have been better
[3:42:13] <Werster_stole_my_bike> people were complaining about lack of open cups and heavy ladder last year
[3:42:28] <FudoV> but why would you make open cups swiss
[3:42:30] <FudoV> WHY
[3:42:34] <Draftbeer> 5th angler
[3:42:37] <Draftbeer> BlessRNG
[3:42:38] <Cnoko> man tinyfin would be in a tier 1 deck if it was in standard
[3:42:41] <ziggythegr8> GM would be awesome if it was like a weekly showdown on a arena like in BroodWar days
[3:42:42] <Werster_stole_my_bike> but i guess people always complain about something so it's hard to know what's best from a spectator point of view
[3:42:42] <alwaysonedmgoff> heavy ladder was much better than these open cups or ladder not mattering at all
[3:42:50] <FireHS> Ladder's fine open cups are wayyyy too grindy
[3:43:07] <raiden_tv1> so what you say? what's better this bomb warrior or a control warrior? @BoarControlHS
[3:43:12] <calderon78i> as a spectator - i like specialist warrior mirrors naviJammies
[3:43:28] <eDead> because hearhstone is the first of its kind

[3:43:41] <ziggythegr8> @eDead cries in MTG
[3:43:47] <sutikshna> @BoarControlHS is he from a money making background??
[3:43:54] <eDead> yes but thats not online
[3:44:00] <eDead> or wasnt
[3:44:02] <Stewie443> and Riot pioneered its way to making esports more mainstream
[3:44:11] <Stewie443> so I think he seems qualified
[3:44:14] <topcrue1> not magnetic still heal you 6 and clear 2 minion
[3:44:15] <ziggythegr8> still it was a card game with a torunament format
[3:44:21] <Jakaso27> Woah boar
[3:44:27] <Jakaso27> Woah
[3:44:35] <Stewie443> roh
[3:44:37] <Stewie443> oh
[3:44:39] <Stewie443> nvm
[3:44:40] <Jakaso27> U haven’t been relegated quite yet

[3:45:06] <casie1> i know
[3:45:07] <Cnoko> oh he was in hots esports so when they killed it he was just transitioned to hs esports
[3:45:08] <casie1> but just saying
[3:45:17] <calderon78i> hots PepeLaugh
[3:45:20] <casie1> seiko can lose his next 5 i can lose my next 5
[3:45:21] <casie1> w/e
[3:45:25] <Jakaso27> I know
[3:45:29] <FireHS> Like i think that if they add relgations when all the "popular people" get relegated and immediatly quit hs they might double think the format
[3:45:35] <Jakaso27> Just a joke :)
[3:45:38] <sutikshna> @BoarControlHS since u cant get relegated y dont u just meme or is big money involved and memeing may cost u some money ??
[3:45:41] <Stewie443> im sure u could lose all ur next Kappa @casie1

[4:12:01] <Zyrios7> just take away rush and giv them charge so they dont clear your board
[4:12:16] <Zyrios7> you could also remoive the "to a minion" from devastator then
