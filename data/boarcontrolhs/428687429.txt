[0:39:45] <sutikshna> specialist format is better than conquest in the limit that all classes are balanced

[2:25:16] <DearNadia69> DearNadia69 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Remember to vote in the Eu elections Boar and chat you have till 10pm
[2:25:19] <DuncanHS> it's brought him this far why would he change now

[2:26:30] <GingerHS> Can george vote in EU elections?
[2:26:47] <reqvam> I doubt Iowans can vote
[2:26:50] <DearNadia69> Yeah at his local polling station, no Id or polling card required
[2:26:59] <lutzundlussihs> hdt shows how much the total attack of each player's current minions, just near your hero power button
[2:27:29] <DuncanHS> it's really hard to find anyone to want to vote for
[2:27:38] <DuncanHS> but voting for someone that isn't nigel farage is still important
[2:27:40] <PapaKurri> do you think it's a coincidence that carnivorous cube and conjurer's calling are both CC for short?
[2:27:43] <DuncanHS> literally anyone
[2:27:53] <GingerHS> you always vote regardless of not liking anyone
[2:28:03] <GromitHS> 5Head
[2:28:03] <GingerHS> just vote blank but you vote naviR
[2:28:16] <Aildiin> i get to work and boar has already been had at work for some hours
[2:28:18] <GromitHS> you have to vote for the least worst option
[2:28:19] <DuncanHS> it's true you should always vote
[2:28:34] <Aildiin> hard at work even
[2:28:34] <GromitHS> every non-vote helps the worst candidates
[2:28:47] <DearNadia69> Nah you maxamise the ideal outcome by voting for the least worst
[2:29:04] <GromitHS> ^^she gets it
[2:29:05] <GingerHS> what if they’re all equally bad
[2:29:13] <GingerHS> naviHmm
[2:29:13] <DearNadia69> That's never true
[2:29:17] <GromitHS> that's impossible
[2:29:18] <GingerHS> ur never true
[2:29:23] <GingerHS> naviSip
[2:29:31] <lore_twitch> fun fact there will be a lower chance to get conjurer's from magic trick after unexpected results get buffed
[2:29:32] <DuncanHS> the eu referendum uses a form of proportional representation
[2:29:36] <DearNadia69> They have that in ireland
[2:29:41] <DuncanHS> so voting for people other than the big 2 parties is more viable than usual
[2:29:47] <Aildiin> like submitting deck for gm !
[2:29:50] <DearNadia69> 5Head
[2:29:58] <DuncanHS> well, we had a referendum but everyone hated nick clegg so we stuck with this
[2:30:02] <FireHS> I mean eu voting system is pretty good tbh at least you can vote for "bad votes" and have them get into power
[2:30:03] <AvaritiaHS> tell that to the americans FeelsWeirdMan
[2:30:04] <DuncanHS> the british public are a bunch of wankers
[2:30:17] <DearNadia69> Nah the british public rule
[2:30:25] <Boc4life> Voting gives citizens the illusion of control. Very important to the ruling class to continue spreading propaganda about how important voting is.
[2:30:26] <GingerHS> Americans in general are just not very bright so it makes sense to have a dumb president
[2:30:28] <GingerHS> naviEra
[2:30:40] <GromitHS> their quality is declining tbh
[2:30:41] <DuncanHS> oh we have Russel Brand in the chat

[2:31:22] <logan2112> And Parliament rejected any electoral reform under the coalition a few years back
[2:31:33] <lulzbuot> how is snap freeze doing
[2:31:34] <DuncanHS> it wasn't parliment, it was a referendum
[2:31:37] <GromitHS> parliament didn't we did
[2:31:37] <DuncanHS> 'we' rejected it
[2:31:43] <DuncanHS> because we were angry at the lib dems

[2:39:13] <DearNadia69> @GromitHS in poliitcis it is lib, being tribal means you aknowlge the reputation of an idea
[2:39:14] <GingerHS> Damn
[2:39:17] <Boc4life> @dearnadia69 I respect your opinion. I do try to spread awareness of issues and how I would solve them, but in general it feels like life is better spent focusing on personal happiness than stressing over politics.
[2:39:17] <Crane333> I def can't do 42 right now
[2:39:18] <GingerHS> 20 years ago crane

[2:39:51] <GromitHS> @DearNadia69 nope, it is identifying with a group as an end in itself, or to compete for scarce resources

[2:40:01] <tictac_hs> Holy

[2:48:49] <Boc4life> @dearnadia69 the last thing I’ll say on our topic - It’s a lot easier to be politically active when your political beliefs are mainstream. It’s much more difficult when your perspective isn’t viewed seriously.

[4:34:33] <ToastmonsterHS> did you forget what that card did
[4:34:33] <MadmartiganNN> ouch
[4:34:39] <Cnoko> what if you developed giant with nova last turn and then went of with sorc this turn
[4:35:00] <magnitro_1803> D:
[4:35:00] <muzzy_hs> -1 mana that turn :/
[4:35:13] <Aildiin> i was thinking the same thng, wasn't giant last turn better ?
[4:35:19] <CharString88> On the bright side: you didn't discard your conj's
[4:35:29] <Draftbeer> okay play
[4:35:30] <NigelTufnel> you get lucky Kappa
[4:35:33] <MikeDear> I deranked lirikFEELS

[4:36:08] <alterworlds> Turns out that Book draw was the right play. You weren't surviving without that Trick into something.
[4:36:39] <Raigar_> uff how did he lose with that starting hand
[4:36:56] <Raidd07> he played hag

[4:37:09] <pacinci> you run snap freeze ?

[4:38:16] <melkorounet> it(s a girl
[4:38:17] <CharString88> Who needs draw 2 if you can go SMOrc

[4:38:50] <SippShip1> these
[4:38:51] <ToastmonsterHS> him = king rastakhan
[4:38:58] <alterworlds> Nah, it's in a good position imo, but getting giant minions early with no bad outcomes when splitting them is a bad thing
[4:39:11] <alterworlds> Make a few more units that have bad stats but good battlecries at the same costs and laugh
[4:39:35] <Cnoko> you never keep zilliax right
[4:39:36] <CharString88> @pacinci The new lackey's will become 12 mana "Costs 1 mana when played from hand"

[6:05:36] <draylors> interesting line to have chosen
[6:05:43] <Raigar_> otk pala is the nuts
[6:06:17] <phoenix1386> Now that warrior has been nerfed, maybe otk paladin will have it's moment KappaClaus
[6:06:18] <MonsantoHS> i played a lot of otk pala and decided not to bring it
[6:06:19] <Carvarx> just play secret hunter, freelo rn
[6:06:27] <Jakaso27> thats why i think that crystology buff isnt that good for otk palla
[6:06:29] <MonsantoHS> cause you can't beat warrior if they tech in silence
[6:06:31] <Jakaso27> because it wins anyway
[6:06:36] <Jakaso27> when u draw it
[6:07:04] <draylors> I was intrigued when I noticed saiyan took pala but muzzy didn't
[6:07:05] <Cnoko> mech paladin? glowstone paladin?

[6:14:43] <spikeb0t> @Jakaso27 his contract was unfair but faze didn't ask any money ever even if they could
[6:15:07] <Jakaso27> I know but tfue was probably worried that they might do it even if they hadn't yet
[6:15:08] <phoenix1386> I've watched boar's stream long enough to know that boar was 100% going to die a bomb FeelsBadMan
[6:15:09] <Porn_Valley> thats fukt
[6:15:12] <Porn_Valley> ggeezus
[6:15:19] <jarmo123> boar your face expression during gm were my highlight last week
[6:15:37] <Kiixxx> Faze has other problem then just him leaving
[6:15:39] <spikeb0t> @Jakaso27 no lol, tfue was told he would make more money when not in faze so he could sign other sponsors
[6:15:41] <jarmo123> not getting dire frenzy i felt the pain
[6:15:44] <ToastmonsterHS> tfue just wants out of his contract to probably join another org so will do whatever it takes for that to happen
[6:15:51] <phoenix1386> once you leave this job you're not allowed to get a new job for 3 months afterwards Pepega
[6:15:51] <ToastmonsterHS> and faze should just let it go i think
[6:15:55] <StreamElements> BoarControl is now on Youtube! For stream highlights and guides subscribe! https://goo.gl/XBMNoi
[6:15:56] <foundyatriggergiggle> bombs is one of the dumpest mechanics ever
[6:16:01] <Jakaso27> tfue may have been told anything @spikeb0t
[6:16:03] <N0toriousDim> do you sign for less money if you remove these conditions or smthing?
[6:16:04] <albrigtsenhs> i think esports needs some kind of rights company like "real jobs" a lot of people just get scammed by orgs
[6:16:07] <PIZZAPARTY_HS> Sam Cooke ftw
[6:16:09] <Jakaso27> but what matters what is in legal writing
[6:16:10] <draylors> yeah, noone wins at this stage toast
[6:16:18] <foundyatriggergiggle> they keep adding stuff to the game without giving us relevant counters BrokeBack
[6:16:27] <spikeb0t> @Jakaso27 the only thing i know is that tfue would never be as big as he his without faze
[6:16:59] <Porn_Valley> it wouldve took him longer to blow up thats for sure
[6:16:59] <Jakaso27> for one that doesn't matter but second off he mightve been, he went from 100 to 400 to 2000 viewers the 3 months before faze
[6:17:13] <TheM0L3hots> Will unexpected results be a good discover from magic trick??
[6:17:13] <Jakaso27> he was growing rapidly before faze
[6:17:48] <spikeb0t> but he would never be invited in friday fortnite if it wasn't for being a part of faze
[6:17:50] <actuated69> Faze pretty much rigged the Friday fortnite thing for him tho
[6:17:51] <albrigtsenhs> imagine how poor boar would have been if they didnt
[6:17:55] <spikeb0t> and there he made his name
[6:17:59] <ToastmonsterHS> they were scared of the vir mortalis comeback and they might try and snipe you
[6:18:21] <pacinci> who're we talking about
[6:18:24] <Jakaso27> @spikeb0t you don't know that, he might've been signed by liquid or tsm or another big org
[6:18:26] <phoenix1386> Boar is only as big a streamer as he is because he joined soniiT1
[6:18:34] <Jakaso27> that all had members with far less viewership and less good
[6:18:37] <Kunizial2> @BoarControlHS do you think that the mulch buff makes the mulch+zil combo good so always include zil in treant druid then monkaHmm
[6:18:39] <ToastmonsterHS> yes shockingly its good when in a business relationship both people are reasonable humans
[6:18:39] <Kiixxx> if Faze made him popular or not he just wants out and make other sponsorship deals
[6:18:59] <Jakaso27> i think he just wants out boar
[6:19:04] <ToastmonsterHS> he probably has fair offers from other big orgs
[6:19:06] <ToastmonsterHS> hence wanting out
[6:19:10] <draylors> heh, decent looking emote @phoenix1386
[6:19:13] <Jakaso27> apparently they tried to negotiate but tfue didn't want to
[6:19:17] <Porn_Valley> he shouldve stil called Banks and let him know
[6:19:21] <Jakaso27> and tfue wants to start his own org

[6:19:52] <spikeb0t> @Jakaso27 nobody wanted tfue on the point faze signed him. he also was only be a part of faze because banks begged cloack to give him a chance. and banks helped with his youtube vids, vlogging, ... tfue was prollu told by his dad that he was better of without faze

[6:21:29] <spikeb0t> every faze member that came forward said they had a good contract with faze lmao

[6:22:11] <Kunizial2> can you eat that Jakaso27?
[6:22:12] <ToastmonsterHS> also only the good contracts have come forward??? Lol
[6:22:44] <spikeb0t> @Jakaso27 karrigan, an ex csgo member on faze said he had a good contract and do you think if somebody on faze had a bad contract this wouldn't be the ideal time to come forward?
[6:22:50] <warfiresf> !lineup
[6:22:50] <StreamElements> https://www.yaytears.com/grandmasters/26680?player=BoarControl
[6:22:59] <GromitHS> this is the esports version of Prince vs Warner Bros or Mariah Carey or x footballer, it's as old as the hills
[6:23:03] <Kunizial2> maybe bad contracts include a clause "do not speak about the contract terms or we fking sue your ass into ground!!!111one"
[6:23:13] <NightFallWins> of course he does
[6:23:14] <Jakaso27> woah one guy might have objectively had a good contract must mean all contracts were good
[6:23:18] <ToastmonsterHS> it would be an ideal time to renegotiate your contract @spikeb0t
[6:23:20] <Jakaso27> subjectively*
[6:23:24] <Jakaso27> not objectively
[6:23:26] <GromitHS> @Kunizial2 that's potentially illegal contracts do not overrule the law
[6:23:28] <Kiixxx> they cant fuck with Kerrigan with contracts hes been in pro for dacade
[6:23:30] <actuated69> Tfue want out of his contract and has a legal way to get out. Its just business everything else is just Banks acting like a moron

[6:23:50] <spikeb0t> @ToastmonsterHS when you have a bad contract with faze and you are scammed so hard you want to leave there is no better time as now
[6:23:54] <Jakaso27> normally theres a buy out clause

[6:24:21] <ToastmonsterHS> ok but if i have a slightly unfavourable contract and want to renegotiate it now is the time to do it, that's why people with bad contracts might not be coming forward yet @spikeb0t

[6:26:53] <spikeb0t> @ToastmonsterHS prolly but tfue did them dirty. If banks lied in 1 of his vids it would come out and everybody would be pro tfue. so i kinde believe that fze never took any money (except fot the 60k) and if that is the case tfue did them dirty imo
[6:27:25] <GromitHS> it's not dirty it's just business

[6:28:37] <spikeb0t> @SasukeIsBeck if they took more tfue would have exposed them already, of they lie about something like that it would become public and everybody would be in tfue's camp. I just hope tfue doesn't get hated for what he did

[6:29:19] <GromitHS> N (puke) ckelback
[6:29:25] <Sevel07> Jebaited
[6:29:25] <SasukeIsBeck> @spikeb0t he cant talk about the contract dude thats why he wants them to release the contract for us to see it and "support him" i think hes contract money leaked google it
[6:30:14] <TheM0L3hots> He is talking about the contract?
[6:30:24] <Sevel07> !drboom
[6:30:24] <StreamElements> "We don’t think that Dr. Boom feels inherently bad to play against and it doesn’t seem like a huge balance outlier right now, so we’re going to let things develop before we make a call on card changes"
[6:30:25] <TheM0L3hots> He just can't release it
[6:30:25] <ToastmonsterHS> reckful is doing a sponsored stream for hearthstone, boar you should boycott playing hearthstone until blizzard pay you to stream it outside of gm requirements
[6:30:32] <Sevel07> ^
[6:30:33] <spikeb0t> what leaked from the contract was faze can take up to ...% zhich are way to high and are scammy AF but they didn't ask for any money

[6:31:04] <Sevel07> so another classic boarThrow?
[6:31:11] <muzzy_hs> It’s a twitch bounty toastmonster. Anyone who gets the bounty from twitch on their bounty board can do it
[6:31:38] <Sevel07> didnt pick astro
[6:31:38] <SasukeIsBeck> @spikeb0t NotLikeThis
[6:31:39] <Sevel07> WutFace
[6:31:54] <Kiixxx> @spikeb0t there was no leak Faze released themself
[6:32:01] <phoenix1386> boar not a big enough streamer to get twitch bounties FeelsBadMan
[6:32:03] <Sevel07> i mean
[6:32:03] <pacinci> instead of pinging we coukd've double banana
[6:32:04] <Sevel07> astro wins
[6:32:05] <ToastmonsterHS> you said a lot of things i don't understand there muzz
[6:32:06] <draylors> same reason why everyone played mtg on twitch a few months back boar
[6:32:07] <Sevel07> if u draw tony
[6:32:18] <Sevel07> hows 2/2 winning?
[6:32:21] <Sevel07> hello
[6:32:31] <muzzy_hs> Spikebot it’s not about them asking for money it’s the principle that they can at any time and any point and tfue can’t do anything about it. Do you understand this? That’s why he wants out and doesn’t care about renegotiating. It’s no longer value for him to stay with faze
[6:32:31] <pacinci> guess it doesn't matter vsomega dude
[6:32:32] <spikeb0t> @SasukeIsBeck they are both wrong but there is clear tfue side. I'm just in the middle and when i say something i get called a kid lmao
[6:32:50] <CrankyPanda> so we try to play 2/2 and ai into exactly tony and sea giant? those dont win if doubled on hand
[6:33:09] <SasukeIsBeck> @spikeb0t he contact is bad he wants out they dont want him to go so there will be legal battle the end dude
[6:33:49] <SasukeIsBeck> lets buff warrior 4Head
[6:34:05] <phoenix1386> warrior just got nerfed boar D: maybe you should l2p monkaHmm
[6:34:30] <AndreasLFFS> whats the drama about? he signed it so he should stfu and sign a better next time?
[6:34:30] <crowriot> warrior isnt oppressive. just nerf all rogue BrokeBack
[6:34:36] <SasukeIsBeck> @phoenix1386 he will be buffed june 3 LUL

[6:36:42] <Sevel07> pala is hard

[6:37:57] <Kunizial2> @Kiixxx wooow slow down now, he may be just 13
[6:37:59] <muzzy_hs> I mean basically twitch handles everything and it’s easy to use rather than the people and companies contacting you directly to play their game as far as I know @boarcontrolhs
[6:38:06] <SasukeIsBeck> dont bully him too much chat :(
[6:38:08] <Kiixxx> thats why i sad how WILL you
[6:38:17] <Kiixxx> said?
[6:38:29] <Kunizial2> maybe you sad too monkaHmm
[6:38:51] <TheoHS_> Yea bounty board seems to make it really easy, just probably paying you a lot less though then you could if you had a direct deal
[6:39:15] <TheoHS_> At least it isnt 1-mana crystology Keepo

[6:40:15] <muzzy_hs> Yeah but I think the point is anyone who’s a part of the bounty program can participate whereas the companies might not ever contact you for a sponsorship in the first place @theohs_
[6:40:16] <TheoHS_> yes boarPositive
[6:40:37] <Sevel07> boarPositive
[6:40:42] <JFEggs> @BoarControlHS is this the new solo adventure? boarPositive
[6:41:03] <TheoHS_> @muzzy_hs true, but that would probably reflect at least partially in viewership and thus how much they have to pay
[6:41:43] <muzzy_hs> Yeah the payment is all based on that as far as I am aware
[6:41:48] <Jambre> time to tech in ice cream peddlar
[6:41:52] <GromitHS> i don't think there's any reason for bounties deals to be worse, it lowers costs for all parties
[6:41:54] <PIZZAPARTY_HS> Sam n Dave
[6:42:03] <actuated69> you get paid based on how many viewer you have in the sponsored stream
[6:42:32] <muzzy_hs> And not everyone gets every bounty. Just whatever shows up on your dashboard with whatever factors twitch uses

[6:53:55] <Khzfan> I’m sure your opponents felt the same when they lost
[6:53:55] <MonsantoHS> if 1 of your decks runs vex crow it beats pala i think
[6:54:00] <fateos> its not really slow
[6:54:11] <Jambre> maybe you should side deck research project
[6:54:16] <MonsantoHS> they don't have good answers for shitty boards

[7:00:29] <pacinci> with so many names*

[7:01:10] <reqvam> spellzerker @ryniano
[7:01:15] <Must0779> can you make a good rogue deck, now rogue isn't as op?
[7:01:16] <pacinci> @ryniano uhm, fib tried that, you should consult him about it
[7:01:25] <pacinci> and beating nomi priest in general
[7:01:31] <Raidd07> tilt has arrived
[7:01:53] <Aildiin> @ryniano just play mojomaster, it solves nomi and mecha thun, and can be good vs zulljin, it is a dead card vs mage however
[7:01:59] <ryniano> Spellzermer might be beter
[7:02:22] <ryniano> Problem with mojo is they can just wait for the next turn to play nomi
[7:02:28] <Aildiin> nope
[7:02:35] <reqvam> you bounce the mojo multiple times
[7:02:40] <reqvam> and kill them
[7:02:41] <Aildiin> they have to wait 3 turns for seance
[7:02:54] <Aildiin> and for rogue i do still play bouncer
[7:02:58] <Aildiin> so yes I can bounce
[7:03:39] <ryniano> I guess but that also takes up 3 extra spots in the list
[7:03:44] <Aildiin> but the issue is mojo sucks if you run into lots of mages, its unplayable as you delay the devastator

[7:28:32] <albrigtsenhs> 4 losses in a row is rough
[7:28:41] <albrigtsenhs> boar is also realising hes 0-4 down in gm
[7:29:07] <Aildiin> the vs mage deck does have a lot of answers
[7:29:08] <Toffi_____> hopporEZ viperhPepega
[7:29:16] <Jakaso27> warrior is favored against mage according to people
[7:29:19] <Jakaso27> idrk why
[7:29:22] <fateos> against warrior u need a greedier list
[7:29:34] <fateos> astromancer are not enough
[7:29:36] <Aildiin> i think the matchup gets decided first deck and you're lucky most warriro for gm don't have a first deck vs mage
[7:29:42] <barnabastheclomper> his list is pretty greedy to begin with
[7:29:54] <fateos> super collider just gives him so much value
[7:30:06] <triharding_to_get_a_name> pepeJAM

[7:30:12] <StreamElements> https://www.yaytears.com/grandmasters/26680?player=BoarControl
[7:30:12] <Aildiin> because winning 2 games vs the deck that has 2x collier 2x bgh 2x brawl and so is hard
[7:30:12] <magnitro_1803> pepeD
[7:30:21] <barnabastheclomper> yeah collider often decides that matchup
[7:30:41] <Aildiin> so to win best of 3 you have to win the first game vs the warrior weaker deck
[7:30:51] <MikeDear> do you play collider in bombwarrior too?

[7:30:59] <fateos> I had games where the warrior pressures me super hard on 5 xD
[7:31:02] <fateos> 4 5 into zilliax
[7:31:03] <Aildiin> they all play 2x collider 2x bgh in teritary deck
[7:31:04] <fateos> its so dumb
[7:31:05] <Jakaso27> just play mech whelp mech whelp cairne undatakah
[7:31:06] <Jakaso27> Ez
[7:31:09] <reqvam> you sidedeck it in in specialist @mikedear

[7:32:18] <Aildiin> if someone brings warrior at gm this week end with their main deck anti mage they will own, but i think all brought it as side deck
[7:32:19] <barnabastheclomper> @ierogliff both i think
[7:32:22] <MikeDear> boarBilly
[7:32:36] <TakeTheMick> @ierogliff i mean theyre expensive but some are decent chairs
[7:32:40] <fateos> @jakaso27, its not even a bad idea xD
[7:32:43] <pacinci> we threw the 1st game we lost
[7:32:54] <reqvam> bloodyface brought anti-mage primary @aildiin
[7:32:58] <Aildiin> i think it's fair to say the anti mage wins 50% nope ?
[7:33:16] <MonsantoHS> he only has 1 bgh
[7:33:38] <barnabastheclomper> no colider = no anti mage
[7:33:43] <Aildiin> no collider it's not anti mage
[7:33:51] <Mr_Underpants> Isn't it because warrior just delays by hero powering? You even said "is this the game where we just hero power and pass?" @BoarControlHS So every turn he is adding answers
[7:33:56] <CrankyPanda> why spellbreaker?
[7:34:08] <reqvam> oh I thought he'd teched harded
[7:34:11] <pacinci> yeah, why's he running harrison in the deck
[7:34:14] <MonsantoHS> you can't win as warrior if you brawl giant conj
[7:34:25] <Aildiin> but anti mage/anti big mechs
[7:34:26] <TakeTheMick> or luna i guess
[7:34:45] <MonsantoHS> better take 16
[7:34:56] <Kunizial2> questing isn't a real card in cyclone mage, right
[7:34:59] <fateos> u just double shieldslam like my opp on ladder
[7:35:04] <Aildiin> you need double slam, or execute + charge or collider for the first giant conj
[7:35:09] <MikeDear> YES

[7:36:24] <Aildiin> feels to me like for base decks the mage is heavy favorite but when you go into side decks the warrior should fare better no matter how greedy the mage side deck is
[7:37:21] <TakeTheMick> thats what happens when you nerf cards
[7:37:33] <Kunizial2> i never just curved out, maybe i should have played good decks in the past though

[7:39:59] <TakeTheMick> i swear i havent lost a game to warrior with mech hunter
[7:40:02] <sasap123> it beats warrior and mage
[7:40:03] <Kunizial2> @Sevel07 hey, once i got over only playing quest druid i actually climbed a bit
[7:40:19] <Aildiin> hsreplay say it wins :P
[7:40:19] <ward0929> i havent lost a game with con war against mech hun either @TakeTheMick lol
[7:40:21] <MonsantoHS> it doesn't beat mage or warrior but people didn't play it because it didn't beat rogue
[7:40:28] <Sevel07> monkaHmm
[7:40:42] <h34rtr34p3r> It’s meant to beat warrior
[7:41:04] <fateos> isnt it fine vs bomb warrior?
[7:41:04] <Aildiin> it's not that good vs warrior
[7:41:12] <Toffi_____> feenSip
[7:41:12] <fateos> eventually just using zilliax on a big mech
[7:41:25] <Aildiin> probably does better vs bomb, but weapon project turn 2 pretty much wins the matchup
[7:41:36] <Aildiin> all their sticky mechs are 1 or 2 hp
[7:42:09] <TakeTheMick> i dont agree aildiin
[7:42:12] <Raidd07> mech hunters best matchup is war

[7:42:46] <Aildiin> @TakeTheMick i play control not bomb, maybe bomb is differnt but as control I don't fear mech hunter
[7:43:09] <Pi_Kitsune> LUL
[7:43:27] <GromitHS> he always get spoison
[7:43:29] <MonsantoHS> he kinda needs to kill it
[7:44:03] <fateos> he got a spiderbomb
[7:44:35] <fateos> he would need to activate it somehow tho
[7:44:35] <TakeTheMick> @aildiin as the mech hunter i always stick a board of 1/1s or goblin bombs and all my minions have charge
[7:44:50] <Aildiin> @TakeTheMick the stats seem widly different between bomb and control 64% matchup to 54%

[7:46:23] <Aildiin> @TakeTheMick project and warpath are the keys
[7:46:31] <Kunizial2> giant + conj is a combo though Sevel07
