[0:19:52] <Blastoise> Ray is so much better than most people rated it, I remember a lot of people said it’s such a bad card when it was revealed
[0:20:07] <evilmorty966> is control shaman viable for ladder? what's your take? @boarcontrolhs
[0:20:13] <trihard_for_lyf> @BoarControlHS what do u think about the dragon version of mage
[0:20:13] <FudoV> turns out apxvoid was right about most of mage card this expansions
[0:20:14] <Blastoise> It’s prob one of the best mage cards
[0:20:16] <Kraslee> i can beat you with my rogue evej if its nerfed
[0:20:19] <FudoV> when he gave from 2 tp 4 tp them
[0:20:53] <Furyhunterhs> I was too tired to remember which eddy I got back from vanish btw LUL so I played the wrong one
[0:21:16] <Kraslee> i can beat you all day
[0:21:20] <ToastmonsterHS> ok what odds are you giving me on winning my 2nd open cup finals boar?
[0:21:29] <ToastmonsterHS> i've stayed up all night for this so i obviously really want it
[0:21:31] <Furyhunterhs> 90% toast
[0:21:32] <ToastmonsterHS> that's all that matters right?

[1:14:59] <WangDingDang> is the sand deck the ladder nuts?
[1:15:08] <pepeletuna> Sand deck?
[1:15:26] <WangDingDang> the one atm
[1:15:48] <dubstepx_> do it
[1:15:49] <pepeletuna> Oh, depends on whether you're grinding in legend or pushing toward it
[1:15:51] <sutikshna> @BoarControlHS best of luck for ur gm match roothing for u mate
[1:16:12] <ZalaeHS> this is lethal I think
[1:16:13] <pepeletuna> I'd recommend the murloc shaman played in gm for pushing to legend, cause it's just more time efficient
[1:16:26] <pepeletuna> But mage is the thing to play in Legend atm
[1:16:34] <quinns1337> so much card draw
[1:17:00] <pepeletuna> Specters going to discard your callings LUL
[1:17:01] <WangDingDang> ye legend

[1:17:41] <pepeletuna> New Shark rogue is definitely legend worthy right now
[1:17:45] <kissandyolo> @boarcontrolhs if u face a lot of warriors on ladder what would u change from this list?
[1:17:54] <UbererHS> worst of luck in your gm matches. im rooting for viper
[1:17:57] <pepeletuna> StrifeCros rank 1 NA rogue list is good
[1:17:58] <WangDingDang> @pepeletuna you have a code? ima try it
[1:18:02] <datfrogger> @kissandyolo add astromancer
[1:18:17] <novasae> @WangDingDang it's the same as his grandmasters deck this week
[1:18:28] <sutikshna> does firebat play today @chat
[1:18:30] <ZalaeHS> not enough people go around wishing bad luck on others. such a sweet power play

[1:19:03] <datfrogger> i wish u ill fortunes
[1:19:03] <pepeletuna> You can run any of the three, but list 1 is most consistent versus mage (the most common thing on ladder rn)
[1:19:10] <UbererHS> fuck you boar. win or i unsub

[1:19:57] <sutikshna> good and bad type
[1:20:01] <pepeletuna> @WangDingDang StrifeCro's list is good for that because it runs way more early board cards
[1:20:15] <ZalaeHS> I don't need luck anyway my Grandpa's deck has no weak cards
[1:20:17] <pepeletuna> blink fox, fence, hench clan
[1:20:22] <pepeletuna> Etc.
[1:20:27] <quinns1337> LUL @ZalaeHS
[1:20:34] <WangDingDang> nice ima try
[1:20:52] <WangDingDang> if its fun im not rly one to care for pushing to high legend
[1:20:58] <ZalaeHS> I believe in the heart of the cards
[1:21:03] <pepeletuna> It's definitely a tricky deck to get the hang up, since it's power swings massively around how well you execute around your sharks

[1:49:18] <yatokami2> myra beats anything
[1:49:22] <Furyhunterhs> 2 games ago I played 19 miscreants vs warrior :)
[1:49:30] <Furyhunterhs> didn't get tog from myra's :/
[1:49:46] <tictac_hs> 19 sounds like a lot
[1:49:52] <tictac_hs> play harrison
[1:49:57] <tictac_hs> Never harrison :/
[1:49:58] <UbererHS> 19 is a big number
[1:50:07] <dale1337> How is p4wnyhof not in GM???
[1:50:09] <Furyhunterhs> ok maybe it was 20
[1:50:10] <draylors> missed shadow step bm
[1:50:10] <Furyhunterhs> you can q
[1:50:23] <UbererHS> 20 is even larger than 19
[1:50:27] <UncleDrewOnMe> why cant you be like bunnyhopper FeelsBadMan
[1:50:31] <Furyhunterhs> yes it was at least 19
[1:50:35] <plbrta> that is indeed a head scratcher @dale1337

[2:55:42] <N0toriousDim> @KeepOutIV20 you jinxed it now, you ll never get past the final boss :(
[2:55:48] <ierogliff> @phoenyx_sam I'm totally OK with Thijs, good guy and well deserved, but if official Grandmasters League stream can't get more viewers than one popular streamer, it means this competitive format is pure joke. LUL

[2:58:25] <Garnix_99> @BoarControlHS where are you from?
[2:58:32] <Phoenyx_Sam> !iowa
[2:58:32] <StreamElements> Boar lives in Des Moines, Iowa. His accent is faked to prevent people from knowing where he's actually from. In his spare time Boar enjoys such fun Iowa activities as looking at corn, and, talking about corn. Ask him about his favorite corn-related topics!
[2:58:36] <crowriot> yeah i meant like not money wise really. but is it actually fun or just triggering cause opponents are just overpowered etc
[2:59:21] <altestadores> he is playing 2 years ago meta i would love to do so
[2:59:23] <ierogliff> @zukahs I prefer Kolento's interviews. He makes casters look so stupid. SeemsGood
[2:59:38] <새벽달빛향기> @boarcontrolhs btw Do you think galaxy pockret would be used in miraclemage after buff??
[2:59:45] <GosuDucky> @BoarControlHS have you played any wow?
[3:00:05] <Phoenyx_Sam> its pretty much the same experience as dungeon runs i did both chapters from the first attempt but it was ok to play not very interesting but ok
[3:00:28] <Phoenyx_Sam> maybe heroic mode is better
[3:01:04] <crowriot> thx
[3:01:21] <shadyshadowshader> @Phoenyx_Sam It wasn't even as much fun as last time, only good thing is the bartender. its fucked up you have to "unlock" the other hero-powers und stuff first
[3:01:25] <Garnix_99> why arent you listening to the original song?
[3:02:11] <zogg7> boar netdecks his playlists almost as much as his decks

[3:13:14] <nobody_knows_best> explain that plz :) @joni13271
[3:13:23] <Herkull> knock knock knocking on the dumpsters door
[3:13:31] <Phoenyx_Sam> the thing is that ppl usually notice their unlucky moments and dont appreciate when they get lucky which happens much more often then they think

[3:14:39] <nobody_knows_best> a Virgin? no dude :) oh ok
[3:15:12] <fermee> i dont like this deck for turns like this. midgame with no giants feels so awkward
[3:15:14] <BlackForce_> is this deck favoured vs warrior
[3:15:43] <Herkull> why you dont play shaman deck anymore? is it not good anymore?
[3:15:56] <Maxis808> frre boar Pog
[3:16:01] <Maxis808> free boar Pog
[3:16:12] <Herkull> how did that happened,u were rank 3 i think with it
[3:16:18] <Herkull> happen*
[3:16:36] <nobody_knows_best> Boar will gain Mana Kappa
[3:16:55] <Phoenyx_Sam> which shaman deck do u mean @Herkull big shaman or murloc shaman?
[3:17:21] <BlackForce_> boom on 7 4Head BrokeBack
[3:17:24] <Herkull> @Phoenyx_Sam eureka shaman with,big shaman i guess :P
[3:18:20] <nobody_knows_best> Boar is VIP PogChamp

[3:19:27] <Slay4daysKappa> Had 2 gians and khadgar last 3 cards PepeHands
[3:20:31] <Herkull> what is warriors win codition? outfatiguing and dr boom hero card for card generation? it feels like some other control deck could match it
[3:20:48] <beepbeepbeep3> monkaThink
[3:21:00] <TakeTheMick> no hero card can generate as much value as boom
[3:21:09] <TakeTheMick> so warrior just wins every control mirror
[3:21:11] <nejxo> why did he waste weapon on the shitty minions lol
[3:21:35] <Herkull> yeah boom is bullshit card just as that omega card
[3:21:57] <TopN0tchBanter> Hard nerfing rogue and not tocuhing boom/omega dev seems like a big misplay
[3:21:58] <NigelTufnel> no worse than conjurer's calling
[3:22:17] <kira_tz13> boom and devestator arent as op as conjurer s calling and mana cyclone and khadgar ..
[3:22:31] <kira_tz13> mage got bunch of stulid cards
[3:22:38] <nejxo> they are all aids cards
[3:23:15] <nejxo> i hate warrior and mage kore than i hated rogue before ... this is way worse
[3:23:20] <Phoenyx_Sam> i thin conj calling should not be a twinspell at the very least

[3:24:23] <kira_tz13> why*
[3:25:39] <kira_tz13> lol did u sfsly go for that.

[3:54:00] <kazarothTW> @nigeltufnel you are talking about just removing Mage from the meta entirely
[3:54:07] <kazarothTW> It’s supposed to beat warrior
[3:54:47] <datfrogger> conj is op
[3:54:53] <Takitdown> lets not pretend conjurer is fine
[3:55:22] <kazarothTW> Conjure is fine
[3:55:26] <ElectricLawnMower> going second atleast
[3:55:31] <kazarothTW> It’s a build around card
[3:55:32] <IdanProK> it is fine
[3:55:47] <kazarothTW> Absolute max nerf it will ever get is increase to 4 mana
[3:55:58] <Darknezz11> Dr.Boom is fine too :)
[3:56:14] <kazarothTW> Agreed
[3:57:40] <Phoenyx_Sam> conj might be fine but this interaction with mountain giant where it gets grave horror almost for sure is not fine
[3:57:59] <patchestheocelot> sick deck, also new order is my jam
[3:58:01] <Kunizial2> in theory they could make conj to summon "devolved" minions, aka 1 less mana instead of same mana
[3:58:22] <Kunizial2> i doubt they'll make that, but that could be a fine nerf
[3:58:38] <datfrogger> blizzard only knows how to up or decrease 1 mana
[3:58:51] <xardass_> twice?
[3:59:10] <Kunizial2> sometimes they increase attack/health too @datfrogger
