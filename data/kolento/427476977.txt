[0:26:14] <Simylol> Rogues can just play decks without party but prep should have been looked at longer
[0:26:24] <foundyatriggergiggle> would be funny if warrior still run bouncer for the coin elysianna LUL
[0:26:28] <bonespears> prep nerf is fine
[0:27:14] <bonespears> control shaman can randomly still do banker elysiana by drawing either card with far sight LUL

[0:28:31] <pindead> I'm so happy they didn't nerf warrior. having a strong control deck outhere to shut down aggro is very good for the game
[0:28:42] <foundyatriggergiggle> what pisses me off is that they always nerf the wrong cards. and then they ignore their new "design space" and create stuff like conjurers. nerf hunters mark, nerf bgh, rotate naturalize but leave giants alone and add conjurers BrokeBack

[0:51:08] <Nightbot> @linkmarine -> Not on my watch! [stop spamming caps] [warning]
[0:51:17] <greensparkle> Keep a brawl. Never know
[0:51:37] <jrohrer13> vs other decks it is not important and plays exactly like control warrior with like 2 mediocre cards
[0:52:24] <Fokki_> @kolento have u seen new cards fixes?
[0:52:26] <lanakias> easy clean the giants
[0:52:46] <GreenCuttlefish> I kinda liked attack one Taunt, 5x warpath, weapon hit the other. Full clear, and you take 7, but only uses Warpath, which isn't too great right now anyways.

[1:09:51] <KelvinLUL> and why dont you complain that cleric is played in every priest deck?
[1:09:52] <maukiepaukiehs> @m4dness___ its prevalence and simply 0 mana -3 for a class that utilizes combo cards
[1:10:00] <Toddler442> @pekoto yeah, if changing one classic card makes or breaks the class... maybe the class just needs a full revamp then?

[1:10:19] <m4dness___> @Toddler442 so make a full revamp at the same time then
[1:10:29] <pr0dy_hs> so all they are doing is making rogue less playable that doesn't solve anything. classes strength contrast will be even bigger now
[1:10:29] <TheOnlySodo> rogue mirrors should be 50/50 but it's like 70/30 based on who has coin lmao
[1:10:38] <nomatt> bye bye rogue :)
[1:10:48] <addemis> hey guys do you notice these new rogue value legendaries? Value rouge no combo Kappa
[1:10:52] <downfall86hs> Kolento can i have that list?
[1:10:58] <pekoto> @Toddler442 DO you really think that there is a chance of that happening?
[1:10:59] <TheOnlySodo> warrior mirrors are like 80/20 based on who has boom first

[1:11:03] <OmTsTM> R OMEGALUL GUE IN 2K19
[1:11:15] <m4dness___> @maukiepaukiehs well, thats the point of it. Nerfing prep means sprint will never be pllayed again, myra barely, and raiding party even less. Nerfing a card to a point where it's not used anymore is stupid. Nerfing is done to ballance stuff, not to put cards in the grave
[1:11:15] <CasiCrusher> Next : Mage - Warrior - Stone Pogchamp
[1:11:31] <Akutammatata> Because they’re making a hearthstone MMO do you think other companies will make MMOs for other card games?

[1:11:41] <Huberttk> @TheOnlySodo like 90/10 if its more than 5 turns after ur enemy drew noom

[1:12:37] <Huberttk> @TheOnlySodo cuz blizzard messed up with nerfing 3 rogue cards and none of mage or warrior, tf is that lol
[1:12:38] <rombosmanhs> CoolStoryBob

[1:14:26] <Toddler442> @m4dness___ that depends on how much those tech choices matter. Like, Dynomatic carries CW super hard because other classes don't play that many Mechs
[1:14:27] <m4dness___> @pokrajac1 rogue is skill
[1:14:33] <TheOnlySodo> 10 mana 10/10 with rush

[1:15:03] <lM4R5l> hi how are you guys?
[1:15:05] <pr0dy_hs> rogue being cancer is fine if there are a lot of other playable classes that are cancer as well
[1:15:18] <addemis> because of very nice animation
[1:15:19] <pr0dy_hs> but if you reduce amount of playable decks then it just sucks
[1:15:24] <alejovar> 10/10 rush = 8.63 mana Kappa

[1:16:10] <skychaelll> monkaS
[1:16:17] <ooups_vl> blizzard nerfed classic cards to dust, FeelsBadMan
[1:16:19] <orestis0082> That has to be a weapon right?
[1:16:19] <FiredUp2Day> LUL 3 mana draw 1
[1:16:20] <m4dness___> @Toddler442 you're right. I still think war will become top tier with this nerf. Cause rogue will still be played a lil bit and will strugglle even more against war, and war willl become stronger against other classes
[1:16:23] <Huberttk> gorehowl
[1:16:27] <skychaelll> warrior weapon
[1:16:47] <pr0dy_hs> yet rogue's average winrate is very close to 50% @Toddler442
[1:16:57] <y1g3> kolento is what men looks like
[1:17:07] <skychaelll> monkaS

[1:20:07] <iamzsch> mecathun and miracle rogue icomming
[1:20:08] <addemis> they will not sap, execute or freeze 4-4 edwin remember
[1:20:08] <pr0dy_hs> backstab doesn't get nerfed at least?
[1:20:08] <St0nedMonk> :)
[1:20:08] <ooups_vl> @Kolento its different guy, same deck tho
[1:20:26] <Wispy_231> @St0nedMonk D:
[1:20:31] <m4dness___> @pr0dy_hs yes it does, cost 3 mana and onllly deal one dmg to a minion now
[1:20:39] <pr0dy_hs> lol
[1:20:40] <addemis> small value is better than nothing
[1:20:42] <addemis> lul
[1:21:03] <pr0dy_hs> @m4dness___ too Op should be nerfed even harder
[1:21:03] <St0nedMonk> @Wispy_231 S-sorry, I didn't mean it monkaS
[1:21:22] <Wispy_231> @St0nedMonk no bully strim 😡
[1:21:32] <pr0dy_hs> but i think conjurer caller should definitely be buffed to a 2 cost, and backstab nerfed to a 5 cost
[1:21:43] <pr0dy_hs> makes sense
[1:21:57] <Huberttk> @m4dness___ even prep rp gives u value of 2 mana draw 2 pirates + weapon what can be messed up if u drew them already when mage has 2 mana draw 3 cards spell and its fine + its only one card
[1:22:00] <boku_no_teemo> anyone knows a good anime? FeelsWeebMan
[1:22:20] <iamzsch> @kolento mecathun op after nerfs ?
[1:22:27] <Huberttk> @boku_no_teemo attack on titan ;d
[1:22:32] <valar_2> @boku_no_teemo, GoT
[1:22:42] <Toddler442> @Kolento what do you think of Exec <-> BGH swap? Execute seems tricky to activate + doesn't do much vs big-ass "Magnetic, Can't be targeted by spells" mechs
[1:22:45] <m4dness___> @pr0dy_hs y you're right, keeps it 0mana, but change the text to "If you're starting the game with rogue, you lose."
[1:22:47] <TheOnlySodo> @boku_no_teemo boku no teemo
[1:22:53] <pr0dy_hs> yes but each class has it's area of op. for example mage is very OP at making big minions in board now while rogue isn0t
[1:23:01] <pr0dy_hs> warrior is very good at board clears
[1:23:21] <m4dness___> @Huberttk Yeah thats bad af. Raiding party being 4, why not because prep exists. But cmn 2 cards 2 mana draw 3 ? What's the point in plllaying it now.
[1:23:41] <Huberttk> @pr0dy_hs any board clear or weapon destroy stops rogue easily, but still the whole class gets nerfed to the ground
[1:23:44] <ierogliff> This game is so unexciting. LUL

[1:27:53] <m4dness___> @pr0dy_hs not the easiest to play, but not the hardest either. You need to know when to buff your minions

[4:23:08] <HauntLich> Wasn't Warrior more prevalent at GrandMasters than Rogue? Why only nerf Rogue?
[4:23:39] <shomiqs> probably counts from rank 50 LUL
[4:23:43] <EleyondFarli> rank 25 winrates LUL
[4:23:43] <Reachground> Low rank I think @Kolento
[4:23:44] <Caspar_srn> @HauntLich warrior is/was rogue's only bad matchup
[4:23:44] <elinile> Its only one guy farming rank 1 with it Kappa
[4:23:47] <Nightangel76> kolento wht was ur favorite deck when it was [Naxx/Brm/loe]
[4:23:48] <vurdalak77> rank 25 wins
[4:23:48] <S1aineTV> 64 not even 69
[4:23:50] <Kryvius> zoo lock op
[4:23:54] <Reachground> oh wow
[4:23:55] <lulkek23> some last roguegames before get nerfed?
[4:23:59] <brokenyouth123> In rank 6 they do
[4:24:05] <ierogliff> @kolento It's easy. One dude played 3 games with it and won twice. LUL
[4:24:11] <Berserker_81> @hauntlich possibly because rogue has no bad matchups and warrior does?
[4:24:21] <SonGGohan> it's because zoo lock is easy to play
[4:24:24] <EleyondFarli> low number of games = high winrate LUL
[4:24:25] <foundyatriggergiggle> 1 guy played 3 games and won two out of them LUL

[4:24:43] <elninoscorp> Senin ben yarraaaniii yerim yarrraniiii boynuma dola sunu mk
[4:24:46] <harnard> rogue will have a bad matchup now, and its shaman+hunter
[4:24:47] <foundyatriggergiggle> hs replay data trash LUL
[4:24:54] <pr0dy_hs> @Berserker_81 control warrior is a bad match up for rogue.
[4:24:55] <Caspar_srn> yeah warrior loses to mage, hunter with dire frenzy, nomi priest that draws really fast and other shit
[4:24:55] <HauntLich> I see, so everyone brought Warrior because everyone thought everyone else was going to bring Rogue? Which a lot of people did.
[4:24:56] <Dalonegunman> zoo players only snipe streamers so they win
[4:24:59] <Caspar_srn> rogue ONLY loses to warrior
[4:25:04] <MarioGoet> @Kolento How to win the warriors with this deck?

A weeb is always talking about how cute or "kawaii" his favourite characters are and claiming one of them to be his "waifu". He occasionally uses romanized Japanese words instead of English equivalents, such as "kawaii" instead of "cute" and "baka" instead of "dumb"

[5:43:50] <shad0wseek3r> mods**
[5:43:57] <shortsss> the only reason people ran banker+elysiana was for the mirror
[5:44:01] <Wispy_231> @shad0wseek3r twas auto mod not me
[5:44:16] <bujabeza> greetings from Czech republic @Kolento asmoDab asmoDab
[5:44:16] <shortsss> so now you can run one more card instead of banker in control warrior
[5:44:21] <BezNegativa> OMEGALUL
[5:44:27] <shortsss> and you also don't have to deal with rogue being as strong
[5:44:31] <AcesFull> rogue got hit so hard, RIP prep

[5:44:47] <pepewins> Pistolento Pog
[5:44:56] <metsejs> and so warrior will be the best after nerfs..

[5:45:02] <Escobarinho33> Do you agree that Warrior players are all cucks ?
[5:45:02] <obsesshs> @shortsss but rogue beat any deck that could out value warrior so indirectly warrior is worse now
[5:45:17] <br0ns0n2k12> ArigatoNas
[5:45:34] <AcesFull> conjurer mage will be the new deck to beat.. warrior is actually easy to counter
[5:45:41] <eigenfree> mech hunter meta incoming
[5:45:44] <suvanl> kadgar dragon mage counter warrior...haha
[5:45:44] <senki529> or shudderwock
[5:45:52] <schatsi> the GM tournament is full of warriors and they buff warrior and nerf rogue, such imbecills
[5:45:55] <smorlul> LUL
[5:46:07] <shad0wseek3r> pickpocket
[5:46:23] <Vegetavegas> yep the meta will shift into mech hunter so the druid will come
[5:46:27] <smilingnavern> @schatsi how did they buff warrior?
[5:46:36] <shad0wseek3r> yes they did
[5:46:44] <smilingnavern> How?
[5:46:46] <420nlz> sihamenoi warriors
[5:46:54] <AllTimePro> by freeing up a slot in their decklists
[5:47:07] <AcesFull> warrior was only popular because it's rogue's natural counter and rogue was beating everything but warrior
[5:47:29] <420nlz> rogue best class
[5:47:36] <idysa> rogue will still be strong tho lul
[5:47:51] <YeahGaryy> yh

[5:48:07] <Frederino01> @AcesFull but warrior decks came up earlier than rogue
[5:48:08] <schatsi> @smilingnavern elysiana was a card that was preventing people from playing warrior because of 2-hour tie games, now these mirrors will be faster
[5:48:23] <kilokeflo> idk the faster aggro decks are hit really hard but maybe lackey rouge will do good
[5:48:27] <shad0wseek3r> yeah like 2 minutes faster LMAO

[5:50:18] <idysa> zoolock is pretty fast i kill at mostly turn 5-6
[5:50:33] <schatsi> @smilingnavern okay I'll make it clear: pre-changed: each warrior has 50 cards in deck. After nerf: with coin you can have 40 cards maximum, without a coin - 30 cards
[5:50:38] <suvanl> cz mech can counter warrior, but zoo cannot
[5:50:45] <pepewins> Zilliax and magnetize egg LUL
