[2:53:05] <magride> REMOVE BOOM LUL
[2:53:08] <magride> th
[2:53:08] <blackhands00> there is a white board at blizzard offices with NEVER BUFF CARDS written on it

[2:53:20] <notrealobivankenobi> @BARCON92 its still we be op, better to remove Boom LUL
[2:53:21] <bbcnylmz> @blackhands00 cmonBruh
[2:53:26] <bonespears> nerfing is necessary if it affects future prints, like nerfing innervate to print heavier minions

[2:53:33] <ThisIsThe03Police> kolento wants 4 mana leeroy monkaW
[2:53:38] <Ottothegreater> Control Warrior is only good cause all the aggro decks are "fair" now
[2:53:46] <BARCON92> Warrior is so damn boring rn @notrealobivankenobi I cant even be bothered to play it LULW
[2:53:59] <Marcelochaves53> i think they have to change the new dr boom, if 2 bombs is considered op, imagine 6 with rush
[2:53:59] <youseemnicexb> pogchamp300
[2:54:01] <nicks6> warrior is op cause dr boom is 7 mana
[2:54:14] <bonespears> 4 mana 7/7
[2:54:17] <Sainthyll> Rogue is way too powerful in arena
[2:54:19] <joni13271> dr boom 10 mana
[2:54:24] <joni13271> is proper nerf
[2:54:29] <joni13271> like zul jin
[2:54:29] <notrealobivankenobi> @BARCON92 oppressive and boring I would say
[2:54:34] <magride> They nerf Priest one Time he never saw play the season you nerf Rogue 10 time it is Steal Playable it's what it mean being OP just like Warrrior LUL

[3:10:55] <AtatiSeven> Last year of HS is like full expansions of filler cards. at least in 2017 they tried something new: quest, heroes weapons.
[3:11:16] <jovack> they maximize by encouraging people to keep playing and keep buying packs. having someone craft one or two decks for the whole release doesn't lead to more revenue.

[3:12:27] <ShoelaceExpress> @jovack I'm telling you if they were to achieve perfect balance where every deck can be beaten by any other deck with skill then it would fundamentally be a different game and they would lose a large amount of revenue from the casual players. Hearthstone isn't a mature enough game to attract cash cow players with perfect balance.
