[0:15:49] <ShoelaceExpress> @shcootly you just need to learn the basics of the game better, resource management and trading etc, warrior and token druid are intuitive enough that you should be able to fly past rank 15 even without knowing the deck's matchups too well

[4:18:35] <grondie12> it's just 1 card. Even if most games won't make it a win condition just the chance it can now be reliably played turn 5 against Control and auto win a game if it discounts Antonidas is good enough for me. Even if it doesn't hit Antonidas it will still have circunstancial value.

[4:56:56] <coolpillow> having a win condition doesnt mean overpowered guys
[4:56:58] <blekzaphyr> if hearthstone brings more cards to draw or search cards in your deck it would be a much more enjoyable game for me, i end up too often with bad draw that loses me the game
